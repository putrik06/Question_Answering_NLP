17311;Carl Hulse;3/01/2017;2017;1;business;WASHINGTON  ?   It?s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation?s health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. ?When you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,? said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. ?There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ? That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland?s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  ?   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  ?   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the ?vote no, hope yes? caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn?t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. ?A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,? Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the party?s weekly radio address on Saturday. ?We assume that responsibility with the promise that we?ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ? ?I am pretty giddy,? said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.;;;;
17342;Farhad Manjoo;5/01/2017;2017;1;business;In the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech  ?   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  ?   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then, in the last half decade, something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago, I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business, one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google?s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable. In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world?s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump?s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year. Let?s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world?s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  ?   mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  ?   on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance. The Five aren?t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple?s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet?s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren?t entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   today?s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people?s skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you?re supposed to in America  ?   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren?t considered that bad. They weren?t causing environmental disasters. They weren?t selling cigarettes. They weren?t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five?s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn?t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people?s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist?s iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos?s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry?s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  ?   entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others. ?During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,? said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. Genachowski?s term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring ?network neutrality,? which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. ?The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things  ?   battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,? he said. That?s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger  ?   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  ?   when deciding how to police them. But there?s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today?s  . The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining,   assistants,   cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.;;;;
17325;Kenneth Chang;2/01/2017;2017;1;crime;After the explosion in September of one of its rockets, SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space, the company announced on Monday, with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday. In a statement, SpaceX  ?   or more formally, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  ?   said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence. The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations  ?   the fueling of propellants  ?   about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the   rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa. Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites. With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor?s building nearby. ?The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,? SpaceX said in its statement. The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the   liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank. In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust. But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid. ?Really surprising problem that?s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,? Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November. Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said. Tests at SpaceX?s facilities in Hawthorne, Calif. and McGregor, Tex. supported that conclusion, the company said. The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said. The next SpaceX launch is to carry a   of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car. A month ago, Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in   but less than a week later, SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January. The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month.;;;;
17336;Isabel Kershner;5/01/2017;2017;1;crime;JERUSALEM  ?   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis, the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March, the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of Israel?s occupation of the West Bank approaching, the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. ?This is a difficult and painful day for us all,? Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon, which can be granted by Israel?s president or the army?s top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces, he added, ?The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters, and they need to remain above any dispute. ? Prof. David Enoch, an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he thought the manslaughter conviction was ?justified? but added, ?I?m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. ? The military?s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once the threat is neutralized, they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger, particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing, caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide, for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force, and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel, a country where military service is a part of national identity, many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal, since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. Israel?s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called Wednesday?s decision ?a tough verdict. ? ?The first thing I ask of all of us  ?   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  ?   we are all obligated to respect the court?s decision,? Mr. Lieberman said. ?We are obligated to maintain restraint. ? Mr. Lieberman, as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment, had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a ?theater of the absurd. ? But on Wednesday, he said, ?We must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. ? Politicians to Mr. Netanyahu?s right and left have also called for a pardon, including the education minister, Naftali Bennett, and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party, who said that ?Azaria?s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure? the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago, after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men, women and children as they returned from work in the fields, unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a ?patently illegal order? that carries a ?black flag? of criminality. It helped shape the army?s ethos. Now, some fear that in the lower ranks, it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions, the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military?s headquarters in Tel Aviv, rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held, to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause, and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound, shouting slogans like ?free the boy. ? Col. Maya Heller, one of the military judges, spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been ?no justification? for the shooting, according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant Azaria?s telling of the event as ?twisting? and ?evolving,? the judge said the defense had tried to ?hold the rope at both ends. ? On one hand it asserted that the victim, Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving, and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria, a medic who was 19 at the time, made at the scene, indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting, Sergeant Azaria had said, ?How is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?? After the shooting, a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying, ?The terrorist deserved to die. ? Ilan Katz, one of Sergeant Azaria?s lawyers, vowed to appeal. The military?s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened, calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks, many   politicians and celebrities, along with Jewish parents of soldiers, hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria?s actions, then phoned the soldier?s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria?s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism, and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service, his supporters portrayed him as ?everybody?s child. ? In remarks recorded before the verdict, the military?s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, tried to puncture that narrative. ?An    in the Israeli Army is not ?everybody?s child,?? he said. ?He is a fighter, a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. ? The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other, Mr. Sharif, 21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack, he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades, in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial, Sergeant Azaria?s company commander, Maj. Tom Naaman, said he ?did not feel any danger? from Mr. Sharif, undercutting the defendant?s claims. Yusri   Mr. Sharif?s father, told reporters that the verdict was ?a good step? but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. ?Fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria,? Mr. Tibi wrote.;;;;
17355;Alan Blinder and Kevin Sack;6/01/2017;2017;1;crime;CHARLESTON, S. C.  ?   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life, the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology, no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead, in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial, Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  ?   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  ?   and left it at that. ?Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn?t and the fact that I?m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who?s ever existed, there?s nothing wrong with me psychologically,? Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, told the jury, which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston?s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern, Mr. Roof returned to the defense table, exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution?s disclosure, in its opening statement, of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. ?I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,? he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. ?I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. ? Mr. Roof, who was then 21, continued: ?I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. ? As the government laid out its case for a death sentence, the prosecutor who read from the journal, Nathan S. Williams, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof?s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. ?The defendant didn?t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people,? Mr. Williams said, a few moments before he declared, ?The death penalty is justified. ? Later, aided by a slide show, he described each of the victims and their lives, setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret, reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology, but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial?s sentencing phase, which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15, after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt, the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes, obstruction of religion resulting in death, and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof, now 22, to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence, jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors, like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof?s flat,   monotone during the guilt phase, when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents, his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase, but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. ?The point is that I?m not going to lie to you, not by myself or through somebody else,? Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom, several women on the right side, which is reserved for victims? family members, left their seats, one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and he did not   any of the prosecution?s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers, who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses, including at least one survivor of the attack, family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church?s slain pastor, and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years, narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together, illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  ?   as a young saxophone player in a school band, attending the births of their two daughters, vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as ?a voice for the voiceless? to his work in the South Carolina Legislature, where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles, he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. ?He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry,? Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said. ?He was that great catch. ? Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17, 2015, as she and the couple?s younger daughter, Malana, then 6, listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband?s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall, Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. ?I was just like, ?Shh, shh, shh,? ? Ms. Pinckney said, ?and I put my hand over her mouth, and she was holding on to me, and she put her hand on my mouth. ? ?Mama, is Daddy going to die?? her daughter asked, Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study, which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, asked why she thought she had been spared. ?It wasn?t my time,? Ms. Pinckney answered. ?I couldn?t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. ? The Rev. Kylon Middleton, an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood, described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and, perhaps, the state?s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney, the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49 Cynthia Hurd, 54 Susie Jackson, 87 Ethel Lee Lance, 70 Tywanza Sanders, 26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson, 59. Near the end of the day, Ms. Thompson?s widower, the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here, told jurors about their   marriage, their anniversary date to a beach, his wife?s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears, Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. ?She had her glow,? he said. ?I mean, this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. ? Word of a shooting came hours later, and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. ?My whole world was gone,? he said. ?I literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her, and she was gone. What am I here for? If she?s gone, what am I here for??;;;;
17285;Margalit Fox;6/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;When Walt Disney?s ?Bambi? opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film?s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to ?Bambi,? which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film?s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  ?   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  ?   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them ?The Sands of Iwo Jima? (1949) ?Rebel Without a Cause? (1955) and ?The Wild Bunch? (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for ?Bambi? that Mr. Wong was  ?   belatedly  ?   most renowned. ?He was truly involved with every phase of production,? John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. ?He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ? In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of ?Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,? a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum?s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  ?   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a ?paper son?  ?   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  ?   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, ?paper sons? posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. ?Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,? Lisa See, the author of ?On Gold Mountain? (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: ?The goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ? Because Mr. Wong?s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. ?I was scared half to death I just cried,? Mr. Wong recalled in ?Tyrus,? an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. ?Every day is just miserable  ?   miserable. I hated that place. ? On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized ?Tai Yow? to ?Tyrus,? and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  ?   possibly more  ?   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  ?   a small fortune  ?   to let him stay on as Otis?s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists? Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members? work  ?   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an ?? creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ?s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  ?   ?a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,? Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting ?Bambi, a Life in the Woods,? the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film ?Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,? a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  ?   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  ?   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for ?Bambi,? it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. ?I said, ?Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,?? he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: ?I said, ?Gee, I?m a landscape painter! ?? Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 ?  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  ?   at once lush and spare  ?   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. ?Walt Disney went crazy over them,? said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book ?Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists? (1996). ?He said, ?I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. ?? Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. ?But he was more than that,? Mr. Canemaker explained. ?He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. ? Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of ?Bambi. ? Throughout the finished film  ?   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  ?   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees? strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  ?   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  ?   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On ?Bambi,? Mr. Wong?s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere ?background? artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  ?   and lent out on occasion to other studios  ?   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. ?Then in a month you?d go back there and the sign was still there,? Mr. Wong recalled in ?Tyrus. ? After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists? Group. Mr. Wong?s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. ?If World War II hadn?t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,? Ms. See said. ?And that?s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ? Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  ?   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  ?   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong?s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on ?Bambi,? Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  ?   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  ?   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum?s retrospective, ?Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,? traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong?s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.;;;;
17297;Stephanie Rosenbloom;14/04/2017;2017;4;entertainment;It?s the season for family travel and photos  ?   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are, of course, the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many   printing services, as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display, be it burlap, wood boards, acrylic or    fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I?d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. I?ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a   home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art, I was most interested in trying engineer prints, named for the large, lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, it?s a particular aesthetic, one that?s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press, which is run by Photojojo, an online photography gear shop, and Zoomin, a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites, you upload your image, zoom in closer if you like, and then click to buy. The site?s engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet, and cost $20 in black and white, and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It?s clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal, glass, newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine, which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having ?a cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan. ? A fabric print  ?   not soft like a bedsheet, more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  ?   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it, you can peel and stick it on your wall. The site?s fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54, from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  ?   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but you?re printing on special material. Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo  ?   crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge  ?   were nicely defined. SnapBox is a   site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic, printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos, which, thematically speaking, seems to make sense for certain subjects, like nature photos taken at, say, the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern, like a skyscraper or a tower, look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn, a family business that makes its products by hand in a ? ? in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas, which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick, and the image was crisp with a slight sheen  ?   a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive, though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didn?t have a problem, but if time is of the essence, you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once you?ve turned the best of your travel photos into art, it?s time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general, these sites are a pain to navigate. They?re cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options  ?   Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?  ?   that if you don?t have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if it?s offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that it?s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans, ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David Pogue?s review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1, 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. That?s one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best   place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn. offered ?the best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested,? Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. Let?s say you don?t want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe you?d rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself, perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally, I don?t want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. It?s free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not   scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration, then go with a professional. However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos  ?   landscapes, food, monuments  ?   that you?re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don?t tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely   activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you can?t beat the price.;;;;
17306;Patrick Healy;2/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Year?s Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song ?Emotions,? struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, ?We Belong Together,? while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey?s representatives and producers of ABC?s ?Dick Clark?s New Year?s Rockin? Eve With Ryan Seacrest,? on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey?s manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the show?s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  ?   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey?s messy performance ?to get ratings. ? ?I will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,? Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. ?I?m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year?s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their? act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey?s performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company ?would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. ? ?In very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,? the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company ?had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey?s New Year?s Eve performance. ? A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. ?Every monitor and   device worked perfectly,? Mr. Goldstein said. ? I can?t comment beyond that and don?t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ? A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. ?Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,? the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABC?s ?Dick Clark?s New Year?s Rockin? Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ? She had just finished ?Auld Lang Syne? when her star turn began to spiral out of control. ?We can?t hear,? she said in the opening seconds of ?Emotions? after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, ?We?ll just sing,? and noted proudly of her song, ?It went to No. 1. ? But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. ?We?re missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,? she said. ?Let the audience sing. ? ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. ?I?m trying to be a good sport here,? she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. ?That was  ?   ? she said, pausing for effect, ?amazing. ? She seemed to recover at first with ?We Belong Together,? but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. ?It just don?t get any better,? she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an ?upset? emoji, then wrote: ?Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here?s to making more headlines in 2017. ? An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey?s performance.;;;;

Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival?s 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  ?   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  ?   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it?s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world?s top jazz players such as Manu Katch?, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Op?ra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil?s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Sch?nbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna?s Sch?nbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably ?Aida,? in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ?Viva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with ?Another Brick in the Wall,? on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city?s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd?s 1979 album ?The Wall. The band?s chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Op?ra de Montr?al on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be.;;;;
17317;Mark Landler;17/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama?s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama?s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. ?The fever in this room has finally broken,? the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. ?We?re no longer in   mode. ? What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States  ?   after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2, 000 American lives lost  ?   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, ?the counterterrorism challenges are real. ? As bleak as Afghanistan?s prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  ?   the ?good war? to George W. Bush?s ?bad war? in Iraq  ?   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. ?We shouldn?t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,? the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, ?that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ? More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama?s thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. ?When it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,? he said in the interview, ?that this is a long slog. ? Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a ?dumb war. ? But in the same speech he also said, ?I don?t oppose all wars. ? He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ?I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,? he told the crowd that day in Chicago?s Federal Plaza. By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  ?   the ?good war,? in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration?s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. ?This is a war that we have to win,? he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50, 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country ?precarious and urgent. ? More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70, 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama?s military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  ?   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a   government. The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40, 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. ?There was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,? said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. ?I don?t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview. ? ?In many ways, I think, he deferred,? said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  ?   20, 000, for example  ?   look like a path to certain defeat. ?President Obama was asking the military for broad options,? said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama?s ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only ?variations? on ?the more robust counterinsurgency model. ? Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? ?When he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,? Mr. Eikenberry said. ?But what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. ? Given Mr. Obama?s innate wariness of   it didn?t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon?s Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. ?We can?t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,? he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. ?Obama believes the military can do enormous things,? said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. ?It can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can?t create a political culture or build a society. ? By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept ?Afghan good enough. ? The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100, 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, ?Wow, this place looks great!? The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama?s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan?s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an ?enduring partnership? between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that America?s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. ?One year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,? he said. ?The goal I set  ?   to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild  ?   is now within our reach. ? Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  ?   on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  ?   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was ?very aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I?d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. ? Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. ?The most underappreciated part of foreign policy,? Mr. Rhodes said, ?is dealing with flawed partners. ? When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. ?The mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,? said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. ?ISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,? Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama?s war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. ?It doesn?t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,? he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a ?broken record? on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10, 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend ?well beyond your presidency,? according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. ?This goes to the politics of what I?m leaving for the next president,? he told the group, according to one of the participants. ?My interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,? he added, referring to troop numbers, ?but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. ? Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10, 000 from more than 100, 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. ?Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,? Mr. Obama said. The country ?was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It?s still there. ? In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  ?   a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. ?It?s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,? he said. ?As commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,? he went on, ?I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I?m not satisfied we?ve got it perfect yet. ?;;;;
17349;Thomas Kaplan and Glenn Thrush;5/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama?s signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. ?The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,? Mr. Pence said, ?and we are determined to give them that. ? He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. Trump?s campaign slogan, said repealing the law would ?make America sick again. ? Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats? being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with America?s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to ?be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,? and added, ?Don?t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ? Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would ?fall of its own weight. ? Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump?s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. ?We have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,? Mr. Collins said. ?And that was a key piece of Donald Trump?s campaign. ? But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. ?There will naturally be a reasonable transition period,? said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. ?You can?t adopt new reforms all at once. ? Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into ?the ditch we find ourselves in now. ? ?When your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,? Mr. Cornyn said. ?And sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. ? To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, ?the first thing I don?t do is dismantle the car. ? ?That doesn?t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,? she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would ?regret that they came out so fast out of the box. ? He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. ?If you are repealing, show us what you?ll replace it with first,? Mr. Schumer said. ?Then we?ll look at what you have and see what we can do. ? Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, ?It?s his and their responsibility, plain and simple  ?   name calling isn?t going to get anything done. ? He added, ?They really need to calm things down a little. ? Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. ?The point is, in 2017, we don?t want people to be caught with nothing,? he said. ?We want to make sure that there?s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. ? Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans? rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a ?pep rally? for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. Obama?s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president?s words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against ?rescuing? Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, ?He acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. ?;;;;

Debate begins today on legislation to dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is scheduled to meet with Democrats about resisting efforts to repeal the law, while Vice   Mike Pence will meet with lawmakers from his party to gird them for a fight. ? Rough first day back. Republican lawmakers abandoned on Monday a move to eliminate an ethics office after rebukes from constituents and from   Donald J. Trump. Our writer says Mr. Trump?s intervention raises ?alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. ? ? Trump on trade. The  ?s pick for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, is a longtime advocate of protectionist policies, a choice in line with Mr. Trump?s focus on making products in America. That effort has made some Republicans uneasy, but some Democrats are ready to support it. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump criticized General Motors for making cars in Mexico. Hours later, Ford said it would expand production at a Michigan factory and would drop plans for a new plant in Mexico. ? Getting ready for legal fights.  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired the former U. S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal fights against the White House. The state is preparing for battles on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. ? Latest in Istanbul attack. Turkish officials say they know who killed at least 39 people in an assault on a nightclub last weekend, although they did not release his name. A video appears to show the suspect recording himself as he walked through the city. ? Challenges ahead for Netanyahu. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been ?the ultimate survivor? in a political system that destroyed many of his predecessors, our writers say, but the current graft inquiry could be different. The political turmoil comes as an Israeli soldier was found guilty of manslaughter today for shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker. The country has been highly divided over the case. ? Rethinking death. One of our most popular stories this week is about Dr. B. J. Miller, who became a triple amputee after a horrific accident in college. He?s on a quest to change the way we die, and he pioneered a model of palliative care that aims to view death as a human experience, not just a medical one. ? Megyn Kelly?s move to NBC from Fox News heralds a major shift in the cable news landscape, and it will give her a daytime show as well as a Sunday newsmagazine. Some industry executives outlined the challenges Ms. Kelly will face in those formats. ? India has become a major center for cyberfraud, as a result of an abundance of young workers skilled in computers and English. A recent scheme targeting Indian immigrants in the U. S. came to light when two teenage workers blew the whistle. ? The price of Bitcoin is soaring, thanks in part to a tilt toward isolationism in the U.

Louisa Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829) was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English, her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors, including the future president, who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U. S. in 1801, when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted, her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas, and her soirees were the heart of Washington?s social life when her husband was secretary of state, proving to be crucial to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her ?Americanness? became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to defend herself only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be a political partner to her husband as he served in Congress after leaving the White House, supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852, both Houses adjourned.

17371;Felipe Villamor;5/01/2017;2017;1;crime;MANILA  ?   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao, according to Peter Bungat, the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization, Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao, which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility, the North Cotabato District Jail, were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers, Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates, the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday, when the jail?s power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. ?It was well planned,? Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any ?high profile? inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking, according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie, who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Philippines? largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization, which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group, Abu Misry, denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no ?specific information? as to the identities of the gunmen, ?though speculation is rife. ? Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago, three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail.;;;;
17381;Michael Paulson;5/01/2017;2017;1;business;Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million, making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record, with 359, 495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square, records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like ?Chicago,? ?Jersey Boys? and ?The Lion King? the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example, $911, 000 by ?Oh, Hello? at the Lyceum, which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17, by ?The Illusionists?) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million, by ?Hamilton?). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week, including seven that grossed more than $2 million, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: ?Hamilton,? ?Wicked? and ?The Lion King. ? The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week, and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high, and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for ?Hamilton,? now the industry leader in pricing, the average price was $310, and the top price was $998. (That?s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors, up from 58. 5 million the previous year, according to Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC  Company, the city?s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year?s is always popular for tourists  ?   and lucrative for Broadway  ?   but especially so this winter, because Christmas and New Year?s fell on weekends, and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil?s first Broadway venture, ?Paramour,? had its best week yet, at $1. 9 million, and ?The Phantom of the Opera,? the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic, had its best week too, also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week, but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was ?The Illusionists,? a holiday season magic show, which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday, and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years, and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: ?Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,? ?A Bronx Tale? and ?Dear Evan Hansen. ? ?The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway,? said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. ?Matilda? closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and ?Jersey Boys,? which closes on Jan. 15, set a record, too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: ?The Humans,? which won the Tony for best new play last year, grossed an impressive $815, 000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course, the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29, as theaters clear the decks for a round of openings in late winter and spring.;;;;
17389;James Risen and Sheri Fink;6/01/2017;2017;1;politics;When the United Nations? top   official tried to inspect an infamous prison in Gambia two years ago, officials there denied him access. So he protested all the way up the country?s chain of command. In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country?s autocratic ruler, the United Nations official, Juan E. M?ndez, was again denied, this time with a jeering dismissal. ?They said, ?Why don?t you go to Guantnamo instead,?? recalled Mr. Mendez, a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture. In Bahrain, officials were a little more subtle, but the message was the same, as they twice canceled prison inspection visits. ?They said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face,? Mr. Mendez said. ?It was clear they were referring to the United States, and they didn?t feel that they needed to give me access. ? Now, after   Donald J. Trump?s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the   war on terrorism  ?   and to fill the Guantnamo Bay prison with ?some bad dudes?  ?   human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses. A return to such ?enhanced interrogation?  ?   and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be ?much worse?  ?   would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated. ?Sometimes we see progress, and then we see ? said Victor   the   of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, a   umbrella organization for   groups. ?When the U. S. was engaging in torture, that created an enormous   of the pendulum,? he added. ?There were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying, ?The Americans are doing it, so why can?t we?? Now, with Trump saying, ?I will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,? you can imagine how far we could go backwards. ? Nils Melzer, who succeeded Mr. Mendez as the United Nations? special rapporteur on torture in November, warned that if the Trump administration revived the use of torture, the consequences around the world ?would be catastrophic. ? A fragile consensus against torture, said Jos? Miguel Vivanco, the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch, could be shattered ?when you have the White House openly advocating for torture. ? During the campaign, Mr. Trump declared that ?torture works,? and he vowed to ?immediately? reinstate techniques like waterboarding because ?we have to beat the savages? of the Islamic State, who ?deserve? such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election, Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position, citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis, his Pentagon nominee. In an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump said that he was ?surprised? when Mr. Mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building. But Mr. Trump did not close the door entirely. If Americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics, he said, ?I would be guided by that. ? Nora Sveaass, a psychologist at the University of Oslo and a former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, warned that if Mr. Trump revived the use of torture by the United States, it would have a ripple effect around the globe. ?The U. S. is a very strong voice,? Ms. Sveaass said. ?It?s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles  ?   the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture, including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account,? she added. ?If one country such as the U. S. openly torpedoes those principles, you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition. ? The signal from Mr. Trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from Argentina to Tunisia, either through courts or special truth commissions, are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct. In Argentina, Omar Graffigna, the    former chief of the country?s air force, was sentenced to prison in September for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two   activists, Patricia Roisinblit and Jos? Manuel P?rez Rojo. The prosecution of Mr. Graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in Argentina, as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its ?dirty war? of the 1970s and early 1980s. In Tunisia, a new Truth and Dignity Commission held its first hearings in November, allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience. The commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955, primarily by the regime of President Zine   Ben Ali, who was deposed during the Arab Spring in 2011. And in December, Bolivia?s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture, murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982. Even in countries that have not conducted such   investigations, new     organizations have begun to take root, and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity. Samuel Herbert Nsubuga, the chief executive of the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, based in Uganda, said   legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect. When the law finally takes effect, ?our challenge will be to bring some people to trial in Uganda for torture,? he said. In the meantime, his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims, as well as lawyers to provide legal advice. But the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture. The inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials, who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes. Those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if Mr. Trump brings back banned practices. ?I am afraid that Trump?s government will question the basic values of the international order, and torturing people will be justified,? said Carlos Jibaja, a psychologist with CAPS, a group in Lima, Peru, that helps victims of torture. At the same time, Mr. Trump?s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries, like Russia and the Philippines, to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture. Olga Sadovskaya, the vice chairwoman of the Committee Against Torture, a human rights group in Russia, said that torture was already common in the country. She noted that Russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames, such as the ?President Putin,? which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim?s body and then running electric current through it. The police like that tactic, she said, because it does not leave marks. Edeliza Hernandez, the executive director of the Medical Action Group in the Philippines, an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation, estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country, and said that most of them had been tortured. ?The government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners,? she said. Mr. Melzer, the United Nations official, warned that if Mr. Trump followed through on his pledges, more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business. ?What kind of message would that be to the world?? Mr. Melzer asked. ?It couldn?t be worse. What happens to the role of the United States as an example in the world, and what would that mean for the policies of other states? If the United States does it, those other countries will know they can get away with it. The last thing the world needs is a U. S. president legitimizing this. ?;;;;
17395;Michael J. de la Merced;6/01/2017;2017;1;business;The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings, how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Decker?s chief executive, James M. Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. ?We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears,? Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman, valued at more than $775 million, was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears, selling one of its classic brands  ?   one it created nearly a century ago  ?   is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S. Lampert, the chairman and chief executive of Sears, has struggled for years to find  ways to help the company, as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes. These have been tough times for retailers. Macy?s and Kohl?s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected. Macy?s also announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close 100 stores. Sears also suffered during the season, with   sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent. Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert, who is also a hedge fund manager, Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers, as analysts said, pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September, analysts at Moody?s estimated that the company?s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1. 5 billion. As of Oct. 29, Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand, compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt, the company said. Its market value Thursday morning, by comparison, was $1. 2 billion, even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday, before ending up 0. 3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled. Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy. But on Thursday, the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position, including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampert?s hedge fund. ?We are taking strong, decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment,? Mr. Lampert, the company?s biggest shareholder, said in a statement. Stanley Black  Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today, only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores. ?Craftsman is a legendary American brand,? Mr. Loree said in a statement. ?This agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market. ? Reaching the deal took months, as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring, Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its   brands, including Craftsman, DieHard and Kenmore, to raise money. Stanley Black  Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid, Stanley Black  Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brands? tool business, a deal announced in October. By late fall, however, Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black  Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman. Under the deal, Stanley Black  Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes, which is expected to occur by   and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million. ?We literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each other?s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties,? Mr. Loree told analysts.;;;;
17400;Emily Badger;12/01/2017;2017;1;business;Everyone has theories for why     professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents? generation. Perhaps their living preferences have shifted. Or the demands of the labor market have, and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting. Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring. Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved. ?There are all sorts of potential other amenities, whether it?s cafes, restaurants, bars, nicer parks, better schools,? said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. ?But a huge piece of it,? she said, ?I think is crime. ? New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Davin Reed, a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply, wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into   and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods. Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities, falling crime has a comparable effect, spurring gentrification. And it highlights how, even if many Americans  ?   including, by his own words,   Donald Trump  ?   inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring, the opposite   trend has brought   change to cities. ?We?re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment,? Ms. Ellen said. ?That has repercussions far beyond what we think of. The homicide rate has gone down  ?   that?s directly the most important consequence. But there are all sorts of repercussions as well. This really has been a sea change. ? Nationally, violent crime peaked in 1991. It fell precipitously for the next decade, then more slowly through the 2000s (and there?s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened). While homicides have increased recently in some cities, rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago, including in Chicago. (Another    reality check, while we?re at it: Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in Washington were rising by 50 percent, apparently citing the previous year?s crime statistics. At that time in July, though, the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015, and by year?s end, it was down by 17 percent.) The new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, and more recent American Community Surveys, to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved. Using citywide violent crime data from the F. B. I. the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities, as opposed to suburbs, as crime fell.   and   movers  ?   and to a lesser degree, whites  ?   appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.   and minority households, for instance, didn?t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer. That may reflect the fact, Ms. Ellen suggested, that   families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime. Or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have. A household facing racial discrimination, high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options  ?   and less leeway to be choosy  ?   than the     households that this research identifies. ?When cities feel safer, that opens people?s eyes,? Ms. Ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods. It?s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime, too  ?   either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term, or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run. Because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling, the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves. But the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex. Wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods, fearing  ?   and reporting  ?   criminal activity where none exists. And such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers. This study also doesn?t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals. Many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population, so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out. But the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer, minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note, Ms. Ellen said, to the declining crime trend.;;;;
17406;Niraj Chokshi;5/01/2017;2017;1;law;Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week. In one of his final acts in office, Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession, fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas. ?While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing, there is still a harmful stigma associated with it,? Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. ?My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it. ? Such charges can stand in the way of finding work, being accepted to college and traveling internationally. The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions, and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving. People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law. Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons. ?Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs,? he said in the statement. His successor, Phil Scott, a Republican, has urged caution, though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually. He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons, according to local news reports. Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69, though most were younger than 40. All but 15 live in Vermont. In all, Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010, more than any other governor in the history of the state, his office said.;;;;
17415;Laura M. Holson;7/01/2017;2017;1;politics;Donald J. Trump arrived at 1 World Trade Center a little before 10 a. m. on Friday to face some of his harshest critics in New York: top editors and digital directors of Cond? Nast?s stable of magazines, among them Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and Vogue. According to a tweet by Mr. Trump, he had been invited by Anna Wintour, Conde? Nast?s artistic director and the editor of Vogue. Also in attendance were Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who has sparred with Mr. Trump since his days as an editor at Spy magazine in the 1980s, and David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who is an expert on Russia. They have been among Mr. Trump?s most vocal detractors, along with the writers at Teen Vogue. The meeting, held in a conference room on the 42nd floor with a view of New Jersey, lasted barely an hour. In answering questions from editors, Mr. Trump addressed health care, climate change, relations with Russia, women?s issues and abortion rights. Mr. Trump mostly reiterated plans or policies he has discussed publicly for months, according to two people who were apprised of the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to talk. When asked about health care, for instance, he told the group that he did not want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act until he had another plan in place, one of the people said. Several editors contacted declined to discuss the meeting, which was off the record. ?Not my preference,? Mr. Carter wrote in an email. ?But I will abide by that. ? A Conde? Nast spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Wintour visited Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in   after she had criticized the Trump Foundation and suggested that Mr. Trump and his family would personally profit from his time in the White House. Ms. Wintour, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, later apologized for the comments. Mr. Trump was photographed entering Conde? Nast?s headquarters alongside Michael Flynn, his choice to be national security adviser. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, and Kellyanne Conway, his incoming counselor, were also there. Hilary Rosen, a political strategist for SKD Knickerbocker in Washington, said all of Conde? Nast?s brands have had a relationship with presidential families over the years. ?It is a rich opportunity for content,? she said. Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue, for example. At the same, Ms. Rosen added, ?It?s not like their progressive agenda is going to have an impact on Trump. ? Ms. Rosen, who had close ties to the Clinton campaign, characterized Mr. Trump?s meetings with media outlets as ?nothing more than an attempt by his team?s part to take the horns off. ? In a phone interview on Friday night, Ms. Conway declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but said it was an opportunity for Mr. Trump to ?connect with the media. ? She added that ?no consideration was given to image. ? In December, Mr. Trump criticized Vanity Fair on Twitter after the magazine gave the restaurant in Trump Tower a bad review. Subscription sales have soared in the wake of Mr. Trump?s criticism, the magazine said. And Vanity Fair printed his tweet on its latest cover.;;;;
17448;Sui-Lee Wee;9/01/2017;2017;1;lifestyle;BEIJING  ?   A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device. For more than three decades, this was national policy in China. The IUD was the government?s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one. Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in. Now, a year after abandoning the ? ? policy, the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her  ?   by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage. ?We shouldn?t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,? Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of Linyi. ?It?s like they are slapping themselves in the face. ? While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor?s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all. But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government?s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child. ?It?s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,? said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades. In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer birth control for much longer. China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs. From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their ?tubes tied. ? Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures  ?   as well as abortions  ?   be performed by force on women who resisted. Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President Xi Jinping relegated the   policy to the Communist Party?s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing. To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child. ?Our country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens? access to the free removal of IUDs,? said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission?s department of women and children. But the   reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability  ?   for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation. The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to ?involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,? Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3, 000 times on Weibo, China?s version of Twitter. ?And now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women  ?   repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit  ?   they have no shame, second to none. ? Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel ?Frog,? by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them. In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called ?shang huan,? a phrase that literally means ?installing a loop,? referring to the   stainless steel ring that was the state?s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications. The rings were replaced in the   by safer and more effective IUDs. According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out. Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small. Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD?s impact on women?s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many Chinese women had ?experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health? from the IUD campaign because of ?rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions. ? Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her IUD was botched. ?In the eyes of the government, women are labor units,? Ms. Ai said. ?When the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don?t need you to give birth, you don?t. ? Even before the end of the   policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang?s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them. But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the   policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale. ?They were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,? he said. The government?s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation?s plummeting birthrate, now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1. 05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2. 1. With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are not interested in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age. Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a    boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children. ?I did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don?t allow it,? she said. ?This national policy to have two children has come a bit too late. ? Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of   who studies China?s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older. ?Most people have already lost the ability to give birth,? Dr. Yi said by email. ?The willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government?s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate. ? Mao Qun?an, a spokesman for China?s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.) Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of ?having it embedded in the uterine wall. ? ?That makes it much more difficult to remove,? Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus. Asked about the public outcry over the government?s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, ?We did not deliberately emphasize that it?s a government benefit. ? Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government?s approach, arguing that population control measures were ?not targeted against women?s rights. ? ?If the state doesn?t engage in this, then it?s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,? she said. ?Women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society. ? But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. ?What they?ve done to women is inhumane,? said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. ?Why did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman??;;;;
17453;Tim Arango and Rick Gladstone;8/01/2017;2017;1;politics;ISTANBUL  ?   An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New Year?s revelers at an Istanbul nightclub. A gunman with a police badge assassinates Russia?s ambassador at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match. Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor. The 75 million people of Turkey, the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West. Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup  ?   all tied, in the eyes of many Turks, to American negligence, or malice, or both. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity. While Mr. Erdogan?s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories. Some are even embracing the advent of   Donald J. Trump, despite his   statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him. In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany. In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion. ?I think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what we?re seeing in Turkey,? said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Still, Mr. Cook said, ?It?s not that far a leap to go to an extreme  ?   can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?? On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as ?an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,? Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined ?Why Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,? she added, ?do they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?? In another parallel to    America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so. The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. ?I couldn?t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,? said Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. ?I felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured. ? After the coup attempt, the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence, renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. Erdogan?s government. At year?s end, the prime minister?s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt. A note said that the rock ?is presented to you as a symbol of Turkey?s devotion to democracy. ? And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. ?Our citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,? Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. ?If they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group. ? Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the West?s reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France. It is this disconnect  ?   between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the West?s reaction to events in Turkey  ?   that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia. ?In France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,? Mr. Erdogan said in September. ?Is anyone from around the world asking France, ?why did you declare emergency rule for a year? ?? Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. ?My brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,? he said. ?From this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it. ? In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years. ?I do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,? Mr. Erdogan said. ?We became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges. ? Mr. Erdogan?s supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to Turkey?s response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism. ?This is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against Turkey?s right to defend itself against terror,? said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. Erdogan?s Islamist Justice and Development Party. Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of Parliament?s human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. ?If there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,? he said. ?This situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, ?security or liberty?? This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies. ? Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey?s broad crackdown  ?   in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  ?   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. ?On the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,? said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, ?there is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale. ? Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: ?Yes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this coup d??tat attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. ? Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the country?s ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the government?s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. ?As we?ve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  ?   so there is no limit,? he said. ?When you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that?s where we stand. ?;;;;
17465;Max Fisher;13/01/2017;2017;1;technology;As the dust settles on Russian interference in the United States election, journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions: Moscow?s ability to steer Western media coverage by doling out hacked documents. Reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for   reasons. The duty, tricky but familiar, is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source?s agenda. But in this case, the source was Russia?s military intelligence agency, the G. R. U.  ?   operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact  ?   and its agenda was to undermine the American presidential election. By releasing documents that would tarnish Hillary Clinton and other American political figures, but whose news value compelled coverage, Moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press. Its tactics have evolved with each such operation, some of which are still unfolding. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King?s College London who is tracking the Russian influence campaign, said it goes well beyond hacking: ?It?s political engineering, social engineering on a strategic level. ? Great powers have long meddled in one another?s affairs. But Russia, throughout 2016, developed a previously unseen tactic: setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking. ?Doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the Daily Caller or Gawker or the Smoking Gun, that is new,? Mr. Rid said. That public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer, Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks, each posing as   in the mold of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks chief. Though neither acknowledged it, and the links were not immediately known, online security experts later concluded that both were Russian fronts. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be a Romanian ?freedom fighter? who had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Using Twitter?s private message service, the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists, pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the D. N. C. and other targets. ?Whoever is doing this understands media. They understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media,? said Sheera Frenkel, a BuzzFeed News reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer. DCLeaks, established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents, claimed to be ?launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech. ? The fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis. When Ms. Frenkel asked Guccifer whether it would release more D. N. C. documents, the reply came, ?Yeah baby :)? Journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with English varied widely, suggesting each was run by multiple users. A reporter with Motherboard, a technology site, quizzed Guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary Romanian. Guccifer failed both, lending credence to theories that it was a front. Those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts, trickling out only after firms such as ThreatConnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports. In July, for instance, DCLeaks published emails belonging to retired Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. The Intercept, a   site, covered the emails in a story that portrayed Mr. Breedlove as trying to foment hostility against Russia. The story did not note Russian links to the hack. Its lead author, Lee Fang, said he had no interactions with DCLeaks and pointed out that the group?s suspected Russian ties were not widely publicized at that time. Some reporters were offered documents exclusively, a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage. In September, DCLeaks contacted Peter Hasson, a reporter at the Daily Caller, a   site, with an offer:   access to hacked emails belonging to Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. The Daily Caller?s story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by Russia and leaked as part of an influence operation. Mr. Hasson said he was unaware of the alleged Russian links at the time. After awareness grew, the front organizations dropped the pretense. The newest group called itself Fancy Bears Hack Team  ?   a breathtakingly overt reference to ?fancy bear,? the name that some Western security groups use for G. R. U. hackers. Tom Cheshire, a reporter with the British network Sky News who has dealt with Fancy Bears, said they behaved ?almost more like a P. R. firm, really? and were ?very businesslike,? doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage. ?It?s the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources, really,? Mr. Cheshire said, hitting on a key to the operation?s impact: the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms. Any leak by any source  ?   Russian agent or citizen    ?   poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters. Do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage, knowing that this will undercut the source?s agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release? Do you withhold newsworthy documents, even only temporarily, to check their veracity and provenance? What if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first? If they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation, does that really make their contents less newsworthy? These are old questions for journalists, but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of Russia?s hackings and aims. Though the calculus of reporting on   leaks may be familiar, one aspect of the Russian operation stands out: the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives. Because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions, all it takes is one   leak to send the document flying across the web. Last year,   hackers infiltrated the United States   Agency, most likely in retaliation for accusations of   doping among Russia?s Olympic athletes. But Fancy Bears struggled to place the stolen documents with American or British outlets. Reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving Russian interests. When Fancy Bears offered the files to The Associated Press, the reporters instead published a story on the   group itself. Fancy Bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with Spiegel, a prominent German outlet, to report on emails that appeared to show American athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs. The article noted a possible Russian link only in the final lines, alongside a quote from an American official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from   doping. If mainstream outlets pass on a hacking,   fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media. That has often included the website InfoWars, which was founded by the   radio host Alex Jones and often publishes conspiracy theories. Guccifer 2. 0 approached Mikael Thalen, a writer for InfoWars, with D. N. C. documents that showed Democrats? plans for attacking Paul Manafort, a campaign manager to Donald J. Trump who had worked on behalf of the   Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally. Mr. Thalen had come to believe, after many interactions with the front groups, that they ?would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried. ? He feared that Moscow was hoping InfoWars, by publishing the files, would muddy the water around accusations against Mr. Manafort, indirectly aiding Mr. Trump?s   campaign. Breaking with InfoWars? usual reliance on such files, he declined to publish the documents. Because everyone has secrets, even if it?s only a few embarrassing personal emails, and because no network is impenetrable, skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target. Democracies, which give privilege to competitive politics and free media, are particularly susceptible. ?An open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation,? said Mr. Rid. ?That is why we?re strong, but it?s also why we?re weak. ? The more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers, he argued, the better they will be able to place those leaks in context, undercutting the hackers? agenda without hiding newsworthy information. He compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease  ?   foreign influence operations  ?   that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness. Still, some media trends  ?   polarization, fake news, the   nature of social media  ?   cut against those hopes. ?This polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order,? Mr. Rid said. Reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations, which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops. This has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or, say, warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak. ?The more light shone on this, the more information you have when dealing with a source, the better decisions you?re going to make,? Mr. Cheshire said. Mr. Thalen, the InfoWars reporter, said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim, but that he considered exaggerated to advance Russian interests. Still, he was unsure it had made much difference. ?A lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases, and I didn?t want to do that,? he said. ?People are believing what they want to be true. ?;;;;
17472;Patrick Healy;10/01/2017;2017;1;politics;Donald J. Trump dismissed Meryl Streep as ?a Hillary lover? early Monday morning after the actress, in a speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony, denounced him as a bully who disrespected and humiliated others. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said he had not seen Ms. Streep?s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony, which were broadcast on NBC, but he added that he was ?not surprised? that he had come under attack from ?liberal movie people. ? [ Read Meryl Streep?s Golden Globes speech ] The Globes were the last   Hollywood event before Mr. Trump?s inauguration on Jan. 20, a transfer of power that many in the entertainment industry have bemoaned. While   comments at the Globes were relatively restrained, Ms. Streep, one of the most outspoken progressives in the film world, mounted a powerful critique of Mr. Trump?s abilities as a performer, complimenting in a backhanded way a style of showmanship that she all but called insidious. ?There was one performance this year that stunned me  ?   it sank its hooks in my heart,? Ms. Streep said. ?Not because it was good there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. ?It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,? she said, referring to a speech by Mr. Trump in 2015 when he shuddered and flailed his arms, seeming to mock a disabled reporter for The New York Times. ?It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can?t get it out of my head, because it wasn?t in a movie. It was real life. ? Mr. Trump, as he has done many times before, grew heated in the interview as he flatly denied that he had intended to make fun of the Times reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski. ?I was never mocking anyone,? Mr. Trump said. ?I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story,? arguing that the reporter had been trying to back away from an article he wrote in September 2001 about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and elsewhere that month. ?People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter?s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,? he said in the interview. ?And remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,? Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep?s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of his opponent, Mrs. Clinton. Later Monday morning, Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, called Ms. Streep ?one of the most   actresses in Hollywood,? and ?a Hillary flunky who lost big. ? He also reiterated his argument that he had not mocked the reporter ?but simply showed him ?groveling. ?? Ms. Streep?s artful denunciation of Mr. Trump  ?   whom she never mentioned by name  ?   drew applause from many other actors at the Globes ceremony, but also attacks online from the  ?s allies, like Sean Hannity, as well as some Republicans, like Meghan McCain, who are critical of Mr. Trump but see Hollywood liberals as only emboldening his supporters. Ms. Streep?s speech did not seem intended to win people over  ?   she spoke dismissively of football and mixed martial arts at one point  ?   but rather to voice frustration and anger before Mr. Trump?s inauguration. ?This instinct to humiliate, when it?s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody?s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,? she said in her remarks. ?Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. ? Mr. Trump said that, Ms. Streep and her allies aside, he was confident that celebrities and others would turn out in strong numbers for his inauguration. ?We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps   turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,? Mr. Trump said. ?All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It?s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. ?;;;;
17479;Thomas Erdbrink;9/01/2017;2017;1;politics;TEHRAN  ?   With the death of Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday, Iran?s political factions knew immediately that any space by reformers to maneuver had just significantly decreased. Change had come, and it did not favor those seeking to turn Iran into a less revolutionary country with more tolerance and outreach to the West  ?   especially the United States. Mr. Rafsanjani, a former president who helped found the Islamic republic, had been the one man too large to be sidelined by conservative  . Now he was suddenly gone, dead from what state media described as cardiac arrest  ?   and with no one influential enough to fill his shoes. Iran?s   reformists and moderates, who would use Mr. Rafsanjani?s regular calls for more personal freedoms and requests to establish better relations with the United States to advance their political agendas, suddenly felt exposed and weakened. Who would now warn publicly against ?Islamic fascism,? when the   sought to influence elections? Who would state openly that there should be a nuclear compromise? Mr. Rafsanjani said things others would not dare to say, all agreed, and his voice had at least created some tolerance for debates. ?  will be happy, but this is the start of a period of anxiety for many,? said Fazel Meybodi, a cleric from the holy city Qum who supports reforms in Iran. ?His death disturbs the fragile balance we had in Iran. ? There simply are no replacements for Mr. Rafsanjani, analysts from all factions say. His death also reflects the dwindling number of leaders from the generation that overthrew the shah nearly four decades ago. Most are now in their 80s or even older. ?It is a very powerful reminder that Iran is at the beginning of a major leadership transition that will play a very psychological role in Iran?s politics,? said Vali R. Nasr, a Middle East scholar who is dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ?I think this in some ways rattles Iran?s political system, in that it underscores the fact that with everything else going on  ?   Syria, the nuclear deal  ?   there will be a passing of the baton to the next generation,? Mr. Nasr said. Two of Mr. Rafsanjani?s most important prot?g?s  ?   Hassan Rouhani, the current president, and Mohammad Khatami, a former president  ?   both owe their political careers to him. But Mr. Rouhani, up for   this year, is fighting for his political life. Mr. Khatami, who has been sidelined by conservative adversaries for years, is now even weaker. Mr. Rouhani managed to create a coalition to win the elections in 2013, with Mr. Rafsanjani?s support. Having successfully negotiated a nuclear agreement with the United States and other big powers, partly from encouragement by Mr. Rafsanjani, Mr. Rouhani promised a bright economic future for Iran  ?   which has yet to happen. With the demise of his mentor and protector, Iran?s president will find it hard to gather the same level of support he received four years ago with the backing of Mr. Rafsanjani, analysts say. ?He was a very powerful figure for Mr. Rouhani to rely upon,? said Mohammad Marandi, a professor at Tehran University who is close to Iran?s leaders. ?Many worked with him because of that support. The passing of Mr. Rafsanjani complicates the president?s position and makes his   less certain. ? Mr. Khatami won presidential elections in 1997 after having received Mr. Rafsanjani?s support, and led Iran through an era of greater personal freedoms and Western outreach that was quashed by unelected,   centers of power. ?It is Mr. Khatami who should take on the burden of the late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani?s responsibility,? said Mohammadreza Shamsolvaezin, a former reformist politician and activist. But Mr. Khatami is all but paralyzed politically. The    judiciary has ordered all Iranian media not to carry his picture or even quote his website. Besides appearances at theater plays, religious gatherings and art exhibitions, Mr. Khatami has remained silent. Mr. Rafsanjani could speak more freely than others, not only because of his revolutionary credentials, but also because of his friendship with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whom he helped become supreme leader in 1989. Ayatollah Khamenei, who has skillfully played all Iranian factions, would never go as far as to completely isolate Mr. Rafsanjani, even when he supported protests that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election. While the presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in 2011 for their criticisms, Mr. Rafsanjani was stripped of several functions but never purged. In a statement, Ayatollah Khamenei lamented the passing of Mr. Rafsanjani. Still, it was clear to many that Ayatollah Khamenei regarded him not only as a friend but a rival, whose absence could now make the role of supreme leader even more powerful. ?The loss of a comrade and ally, with whom I share a friendship that dates back to 59 years ago, is difficult and ? said a statement posted on Ayatollah Khamenei?s website on Sunday. He also referred obliquely to their disagreements. ?Differences in views and interpretations of Islamic law in various points of this long time could never break the friendship,? the statement said. ?After him, I cannot think of anyone with whom I share such long history and experience along the highs and lows of historical moments. ?   joined in on the mourning, giving public statements of condolence, but with the realization that the political wind in Iran would now blow even more in their favor. For them Mr. Rafsanjani had been a wild card, who could evoke rulings from the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, that would oppose their rigid narrative of isolation and  . Mr. Rafsanjani was especially dangerous, they said, because of his conviction that Iran had changed and that establishing relations with the United States was the only way to secure the future of the Islamic republic. Mr. Rafsanjani also had cordial ties with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran?s principal rival in the Middle East, who share a mutual hostility with Ayatollah Khamenei.   also have faulted Mr. Rafsanjani for having founded a chain of affordable universities during the reconstruction that followed the     war. Some conservatives now blame these schools for having helped sow what they regard as the dangerous modernist aspirations of Iran?s middle class. Many conservatives in Iran also suspected Mr. Rafsanjani of having used his contacts to undercut Ayatollah Khamenei on issues where Ayatollah Khamenei would choose ideology over diplomacy. Mr. Rafsanjani preferred pragmatism and change to keep the ruling system in power. ?The invisible hands of the late Ali Akbar Rafsanjani are gone,? said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   political analyst who has close relations with many of Iran?s top leaders. ?This means an end to secret meetings by reformists and moderates seeking closer ties with America from now on we can make decisions much easier and with more coordination. ?;;;;
17484;Isabel Kershner;9/01/2017;2017;1;crime;JERUSALEM  ?   A Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon, killing four and injuring 17 others, according to the police and witnesses. The police called the episode an act of terrorism. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said the attacker had been shot, and the police released images showing the truck?s windshield riddled with bullet holes. The dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier, the Israeli military confirmed. Several people were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was ?by all indications a supporter of the Islamic State. ? ?This is part of the same pattern inspired by Islamic State, by ISIS, that we saw first in France, then in Germany and now in Jerusalem. This is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism,? he added. Mr. Netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against Israelis and those in the rest of the world, though the attacks in Israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the   conflict. While the Israeli security services have described a few Palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State, no direct links have been established between them and the organization. The attack on Sunday occurred on the Armon Hanatziv Promenade, a popular tourist spot between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the Old City. The four soldiers killed were Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Shir Hajaja, 22, from Maale Adumim in the West Bank and Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. The violence ended several months of relative calm in the contested city, after a period of frequent stabbings, shootings and car attacks. It also underlined the volatility of the situation at a time when   Donald J. Trump has promised to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a potentially explosive step that American administrations have avoided for decades. Palestinian officials say it would destroy the chances of any peace process by prejudging the outcome, and some have said it would constitute a declaration of war against Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, said on Friday that the Palestinians would view any such change in the status quo in Jerusalem as the crossing of a red line. Mosque preachers addressed the proposed embassy move in their sermons during Friday prayers, apparently on the instruction of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel captured the area from Jordan in the 1967 war and claims sovereignty there. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds sway in Gaza, praised Sunday?s attack, without taking responsibility for it. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas official, described it as a ?courageous and heroic operation. ? In Gaza City, people were handing out sweets to   in celebration. Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned the attack in a statement. ?It is reprehensible that some choose to glorify such acts, which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis,? he said. ?There is nothing heroic in such actions. ? The Palestinian official news agency, WAFA, identified the driver of the truck as Fadi Ahmad   28, a resident of the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem. Ribhi Ewiysat, a resident of the neighborhood, said that a large number of Israeli security forces had entered the area and were at the attacker?s house. Chaim Newman, a tour guide who was accompanying the group of soldiers at the scene, told Israel Radio, ?The soldiers got off the bus, and we were getting organized when suddenly the truck came with great speed and rammed into the group. ? ?Civilians and soldiers began shooting, and this prevented a worse tragedy,? he added. ?He rammed them a number of times, going into reverse and forward in order to hurt more people. ? Chen Lendi Sharon, a paramedic from the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said there was ?chaos on the scene? when she arrived. ?I saw a truck that rammed youngsters getting off the bus next to the Armon Hanatziv observation point. ? Ms. Lendi Sharon said that at least 10 people were trapped under the bus or were lying on the grass by the road. The attack occurred around 1:30 p. m. Dozens of soldiers were getting off buses at the site as part of a routine educational tour of Jerusalem. Aged 18 to 21, they were cadets from an officers? course, Israel Radio reported. About two hours after the attack, the truck, a white flatbed with a crane on the back, remained at the scene and an ambulance was still removing bodies. Dovy Meyer, a spokesman for the United Hatzalah ambulance service who was at the scene, said that around 100 soldiers had been milling about when the attack occurred. A spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks began in October 2015 and quickly spread from Jerusalem and the West Bank to cities around Israel. More than 30 Israelis and two American visitors were among those killed in the attacks. More than 240 Palestinians have been killed during that period, many of them while carrying out or intending to carry out attacks, according to Israeli officials. Several attackers have come from the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood. Mr. Netanyahu said the neighborhood had been ?encircled? by security forces on Sunday.;;;;
17490;Michael Paulson and Michael Barbaro;8/01/2017;2017;1;politics;Hillary Clinton, who has kept a relatively low public profile since losing the presidential election two months ago, on Sunday showed up at the final performance of the Broadway revival of ?The Color Purple,? reveling in the story of a beleaguered woman who triumphs over the oppressive men in her life (and, along the way, discovers a love for colorful pants). Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, received several ovations from the   audience as she arrived, and then another round of applause when she was acknowledged by the cast after the show. ?There?s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today,? the actress Patrice Covington, who gave the farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show, said to the audience. ?I?m not going to call all of them out  ?   I know you already know them,? she said, before pausing, looking in Mrs. Clinton?s direction, and waving at her mischievously. At that, the audience erupted into a new, loud round of applause. The reaction was substantially warmer than the scattered booing and clapping that greeted the arrival of Vice   Mike Pence when he attended ?Hamilton,? just one block north, on Nov. 18. ?We love you Hillary,? some audience members shouted. Several thanked Mrs. Clinton and told her, ?God bless you. ? ?God bless you,? Mrs. Clinton replied. Mrs. Clinton was besieged by   before the show, at intermission and as she was ushered out a side door after the musical ended (?Whoa!? said her husband as they left.) Jordan Serpone, 33, an audience member from Boston, said that spotting Mrs. Clinton was a surprisingly moving experience for him. ?I was having every emotion I?ve tried to get rid of over the past few weeks,? he said during intermission. He shook her hand, but said he is still filled with frustration over her loss. ?She shouldn?t be here. She should be planning her cabinet,? he said. Because the Sunday matinee was the last performance for the acclaimed production, which won last year?s Tony award for best musical revival, the crowd was starry: Among those in the audience were Jonathan Groff, Mariska Hargitay, Gayle King, Debra Messing, Leslie Odom Jr. Billy Porter, Phylicia Rashad and Anna Wintour. Public sightings of Mrs. Clinton in the weeks since the election have been sufficiently rare that they create a stir on social media. Strangers have sought photographs with her at stores and in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. But Mrs. Clinton has indicated that she and her husband plan to attend the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president on Jan. 20. ?The Color Purple? tells the searing story of a young black woman abused by her stepfather and her husband in rural Georgia in the early 20th century. The musical is an adaptation of a   1982 novel, by Alice Walker, which was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Steven Spielberg adapted the novel into a film in 1985, and Oprah Winfrey, who was featured in the film, went on to become an important champion, and   of the musical. The musical has been one of the most successful at attracting black audiences to Broadway. It first opened on Broadway in 2005, and features a book by Marsha Norman and music and lyrics by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis. The revival, which opened in 2015 and was directed by John Doyle, featured a   performance by the British actress Cynthia Erivo. She won a Tony award for best actress in a leading role in a musical. The last show took place on Ms. Erivo?s 30th birthday.;;;;
17496;Emily Palmer;9/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;He was not her type. He was too old for her. She would never give him her number. And then she did. And he called her. And they fell in love. He called three times a day for a week before she finally answered. Alena Kastsiuk picked up the phone that May morning in 2011 only to yell at him for waking her. ?How about sushi?? he responded. Ms. Kastsiuk, a waitress who had worked other   jobs, had little money for such luxuries. Her refrigerator was empty, so she agreed. The sushi date lasted five and a half hours. Although he was almost twice her age, Ms. Kastsiuk, a film directing major from Belarus struggling to find her way into New York?s film industry, discovered much in common with the Russian pianist across from her. The pianist, Vladimir Spitsberg, had arrived in New York State more than 20 years earlier, worked as a digital media arts instructor at Touro College in Manhattan and played with his band, Gypsy Fun Trio, at a Russian restaurant and piano bar in Midtown Manhattan. ?I fell in love that day,? said Ms. Kastsiuk, now 29. ?And I didn?t even understand love yet. ? They married three weeks later. ?Maybe three and a half weeks,? she said. It was not a marriage of convenience. Neither was a United States citizen. They married for love, but the ceremony was a nightmare. On what was supposed to be her wedding day, Ms. Kastsiuk discovered that the security tag was still attached to her dress. Mr. Spitsberg pulled at it, and yellow paint exploded on her gown. She changed into a sundress, and they hurtled to the Brooklyn clerk?s office with 30 minutes to spare before it closed. But they forgot their rings and had to turn back to retrieve them. They made it back to the clerk?s office just after it closed. Friends were waiting at Uncle Vanya Cafe in Midtown and the party could not be called off, so they put together an impromptu ceremony with a friend splashing them with Cognac and sliding the rings over their fingers. He declared them married. The next morning, they returned to the clerk?s office to marry for real. By 2014, they had created Karma World Productions, a film company, where she handled the editing and videography and he produced the music. Ms. Kastsiuk had noticed signs of her husband?s health problems  ?   his ashen face and frequent sweats  ?   before their marriage. Sometimes he would collapse on her couch, unable to make it home. But he did not tell her about his longtime heart and blood pressure problems. Mr. Spitsberg lost his teaching job in 2014. His band started to play at a different restaurant later that year, leading to further stress. He was asked to advise a film project about Russian immigrants in the United States, but the job fell through. He agreed to compose the film?s score, instead. Depressed, Mr. Spitsberg drank, skipped his heart medication and refused to go to a hospital. Helpless, Ms. Kastsiuk watched as his late hours with the band and heavy drinking took a toll. ?I was fighting for him all the time,? she said. ?But his style of life was taking him away from me. ? On May 13, Ms. Kastsiuk heard her husband calling from the bedroom. ?He was sitting on the bed, white and sweating,? she said. ?Everything was wet. ? She called 911 and waited for help. ?Sit close to me,? he said. When emergency responders arrived, the numbness in his chest had spread to his legs. As Mr. Spitsberg was taken to a hospital, Ms. Kastsiuk followed on a bicycle, calling his cellphone repeatedly on the way. But Mr. Spitsberg, 51, was pronounced dead before she arrived. In the emergency room, she held his hand, not letting go until his fingers turned blue. On a cold December morning, sitting inside a Midtown office, seven months after his death, Ms. Kastsiuk still spoke of him in the present tense. She reflected on a life beginning with their romance. She had come to New York in 2008 at 21, initially on a student visa. With $100 in her pocket, she supported herself as a maid, a waitress and a flower seller. Meeting college students in film school in fall 2010, she produced several small video projects. But Mr. Spitsberg had introduced her to an entirely different New York, with evenings at Samovar, the Midtown restaurant where his band played, drinking vodka and singing Russian songs. She networked with producers, became a business partner with her husband and made films. Without children, the couple got a West Highland white terrier. Returning to their Coney Island apartment on the day he died, she felt trapped, as if still in the moments before his death. Valeriy Zhmud, the friend who led the couple?s unofficial marriage ceremony, joined her with a bottle of Mr. Spitsberg?s favorite pinot noir, and she opened the fridge to find the pork that he had cooked the day before. Overcome, she threw it out. But life outside the apartment continued. The band hired another pianist. The couple?s film company halted operation. Financial trouble, which had been a problem for years, increased after his death. Though she is in the country legally, Ms. Kastsiuk does not have a green card, something she is pursuing now. She received a   payment of $255 from Social Security after her husband?s death. Without his income, she is looking for a roommate to split the cost of her $1, 350 rent. Over the summer, the Jewish Board of Family and Children?s Services, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided Ms. Kastsiuk with $1, 481 of Neediest funds to cover one month?s rent and electricity. ?I didn?t know what to do,? Ms. Kastsiuk recalled. ?And I didn?t think they?d help me. I?m not Jewish, but that didn?t matter to them. ? The organization has helped with another month?s rent and provided bereavement counseling to help her start over in a city filled with memories of her husband. She takes comfort in walks with their dog. ?He?s the only family I have right now,? she said. ?He looks at me and understands my heart. ?;;;;
17504;Vivian Yee;10/01/2017;2017;1;politics;Delivering the first of six State of the State addresses planned around the state this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday located the cure to the nation?s political fever in New York State, implicitly offering himself as an antidote to a   whose name went unmentioned. ?New York knows that our progressive principles of acceptance and diversity are not the enemy of our middle class, and we know that   success is not the enemy of our progressive beliefs,? he said. ?In fact, it was the progressive policies that created the nation?s middle class in the first place. ? Ahead of his scheduled stops in western and central New York, on Long Island, in Westchester County and in Albany, Mr. Cuomo?s remarks in a   room at 1 World Trade Center colored largely within state lines. But remarkably for a politician who has avoided even the appearance of White House ambitions since entering the governor?s mansion in 2011, his speech also seemed aimed at an audience outside New York. Mr. Cuomo reiterated his promise to upgrade Queens?s two major airports, but he dwelled far longer on the reality on Queens?s streets. There, he said, the economic recovery trumpeted by the Obama administration had somehow never gotten around to the Hillside Avenue gas station where he worked as a teenager or the ?pizzeria where we hung out. ? ?It is not what they feel,? he said, referring to the white   voters who proved so receptive to Donald J. Trump?s candidacy. ?It is not their reality. ? Lines drawn from the Elizabeth Warren syllabus got the Cuomo treatment (at one point, he noted that the Wall Street executives who presided over the financial crisis were never punished). One of Mr. Cuomo?s chief proposals on Monday was a ?  recovery act? that he said would provide jobs and erect infrastructure, expand access to education and lower taxes. Lest anybody miss the point, the governor?s staff circulated ?key takeaways? and quotations from the speech, billing the address as a groundbreaking blueprint for moving forward in the Trump era. There were   ?   proposals covering what seemed like the whole spectrum of liberal causes. Doubling the   tax credit for more than 200, 000 families. Executive orders intended to reduce a wage gap for women working for the state. Criminal justice reforms affecting the state?s bail system, recordings of police interrogations, the age of criminal liability and access to a speedy trial.   voter registration and early voting. Mr. Cuomo proposed a defense fund guaranteeing legal representation to immigrants, as well as passing the Dream Act, a   piece of legislation that would open financial aid at state colleges to undocumented immigrants. For environmentalists, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a deal, reported by The New York Times on Friday, that would lead to the shutdown of Indian Point, a nuclear plant north of New York City. The governor had already announced several initiatives before the speech, including a pledge to cover tuition costs at state universities and community colleges for families making up to $125, 000 a year. Some of his ideas seemed to be flags planted directly on the liberal territory previously staked out by Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, who listened from the second row on Monday  ?   the latest subplot of a feud between governor and mayor that recently reached new depths over the death of a   deer. Mr. Cuomo even took credit for establishing a universal prekindergarten program in New York City, a mayoral proposal ultimately financed by Albany. Yet for all that Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might find to like in the speech, Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized by the left over collaborating with Republicans, faces a bumpy session in Albany. Legislators have taken the governor?s decision to split the traditional State of the State address in Albany into six regional events as a snub, and legislative leaders have declined to attend. But there was someone present who wanted to air the legislators? grievances, however lonely the quest. About 64 floors below the pristine white room in which Mr. Cuomo spoke, Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a Trump supporter who had been denied entrance, monitored the proceedings from a Joe  the Juice shop. ?He?s afraid to face them,? Mr. Cox said outside afterward, referring to state legislators. ?So he?s running around the state giving great speeches that really sound like speeches for someone who?d like to be president of the United States, rather than someone who?s governor of New York State. ? In the cold wind, Mr. Cox fended off a shiver. He planned to follow the governor to his afternoon speech in Buffalo, where Mr. Cox would be, doubtless, equally unwelcome.;;;;
17510;;10/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;Here?s a look at the most memorable moments from the 2017 Golden Globes, including Meryl Streep?s acceptance speech, Jimmy Fallon?s lackluster hosting, funny presenters and awkward flubs. Meryl Streep campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton, so expectations were high that when she took the Golden Globes stage to accept the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she would comment on the recent election. But how political would she be? Pretty political, as it turned out. She used her speech to call out   Donald J. Trump for seeming to mock a disabled New York Times reporter, and to warn that a free press would need to be defended. ?This instinct to humiliate, when it?s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody?s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,? she said. ?Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. ? The room roundly applauded her remarks, but on social media some conservative commentators immediately criticized her and the target of her remarks had his own take. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Streep as ?a Hillary lover? and said that while he had not watched the ceremony, he was ?not surprised? to come under attack from ?liberal movie people. ?  ?   Daniel Victor and Patrick Healy Read the full text of Meryl Streep?s remarks and read more about the  ?s comments. Jimmy Fallon, generally an ebullient cruise director for awards shows, wasn?t a presence so much as a nuisance. The ?La La Land? intro only really worked if you?d already seen ?La La Land,? and the segment lacked the pep and fun of, for example, his ?Glee?  musical intro to the 2010 Emmys. There was barely a monologue, but a teleprompter snafu probably shouldn?t derail a comedian who hosts a TV show five nights a week. The rest of his material was tiny  ?   and not funny  ?   interstitials introducing the presenters with strained wordplay. Does this show need a host? Maybe not.  ?   Margaret Lyons Read a review of the telecast. Even cynical   watchers had to smile when the songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, ages 31 and 32, came bounding onto the stage to collect their Globe for the moody ?La La Land? tune ?City of Stars. ? The young men had clearly not yet received the show business memo that awards are to be accepted with practiced (false) modesty and coolness. ?We need to calm down!? shouted Mr. Paul. ?We?re so nervous!? They charmingly dedicated their best song award to ?musical theater nerds everywhere. ? (Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul also wrote the music for the celebrated ?Dear Evan Hansen. ?) The same kind of emotion could also been seen whenever the cameras passed the ?La La Land? table, where the two producers who shepherded the film the longest, Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz, ages 35 and 36, could be seen melting down with joy as their film racked up one prize after another. Add in multiple trips to the stage by the film?s director, Damien Chazelle, 31, and it felt like an arrival moment for a new set of Young Turks. On to the Oscars?  ?   Brooks Barnes Read about the making of ?La La Land. ? There?s no movie called ?Hidden Fences. ? There?s ?Fences,? starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, and there?s ?Hidden Figures,? starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mone. First Jenna Bush Hager said it on NBC?s red carpet show when she was interviewing Pharrell Williams (who is a producer of ?Hidden Figures?) and then Michael Keaton said it onstage. Look alive out there, folks.  ?   Margaret Lyons Read about Pharrell Williams?s reaction. Donald Glover?s two acceptance speeches for his work on the FX show ?Atlanta? were touching and personal (?I grew up in a house where magic wasn?t allowed?) and also hilarious (?I?d like to thank the Migos  ?   not for being on the show, but for making ?Bad and Boujee.? That?s the best song ever?). ?Atlanta? was one of the best, most distinctive shows of last season, and everything about the show?s win, and Mr. Glover?s velvet suit, and the cast?s   portrait felt unique and just right.  ?   Margaret Lyons Read the complete list of Golden Globe winners. It was a night of facial hair and sparkles, fairy princess frocks and character dressing, with the characters, and the (Hollywood) royals, dressed straight from the silver screen playbook. Of course, some costumes are less obvious than others. And when it comes to the red carpet, at least pretending to dress as yourself as opposed to, say, a cut flower or Disney caricature, has power. Ruth Negga, for example, in a   sequined   gown (who doesn?t love the idea of a   gown?) by Louis Vuitton, took the idea of dressing for the award you want, a popular seasonal trope, and gave it a dose of futuristic cool. Evan Rachel Wood, channeling Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie (and Julie Andrews in ? ?) in an exactingly cut Altuzarra tux with white vest, offered absolute proof of her words that when it comes to awards season, there was no dress required. And Thandie Newton, in    white Monse, flames picked out in paillettes licking up her hem, just hinted at the idea of an avenging angel come to earth. Also on the   list, though in a more classical mode: Emma Stone, in     (pink was a trend) Valentino, metaphor obvious but still undeniably enchanting Brie Larson, in strapless red Rodarte with a draped and beaded bodice, matching lips and Veronica Lake hair Natalie Portman, in ?  chartreuse Prada maternity gown, a little ?Jackie,? but not too much and Viola Davis in sunshine yellow   sequined Michael Kors, so bright she gave off her own light. For good or ill, Fashion with a capital F dresses can often look overdone or out of place on what has become a pretty visually safe space, and such was the case with Nicole Kidman?s Scottish shipwreck of a   corseted Alexander McQueen. Ditto Sarah Jessica Parker?s white   Vera Wang, with its echoes of both wedding dresses past and Princess Leia. And ditto Janelle Mone?s   Armani: short in front, trailing in back, sequined on top. Just when you had taken one detail in: whoa! There was another. The red carpet just doesn?t reward risk. At least the very boring  ?   all those sequined columns, yawn  ?   doesn?t linger long in the brain.  ?   Vanessa Friedman Read a review of the night?s looks and see a red carpet slide show. In ?Nocturnal Animals,? Tom Ford?s twisty drama, Aaron   plays a sadistic thug who menaces a family on a deserted highway. Critics singled out the terrifying performance but on the awards circuit so far, the actor had garnered just one award (from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival) before his surprise Golden Globe for best supporting actor. Left   were favorites like Mahershala Ali (?Moonlight?). On the red carpet, Mr.   said he watched movies about Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer to prepare, while his wife, the director Sam   confessed, ?It wasn?t my favorite part. ?  ?   Stephanie Goodman  Read a review of ?Nocturnal Animals. ? Tracee Ellis Ross?s acceptance speech was an elegant combination of meaningful ideas and gleeful spontaneity. Winning the Globe for best actress in a comedy (? ?) Ms. Ross said that her award was also for ?all of the women, women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas and thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important. ? She said that it?s ?an honor? to be on a show that tells stories ?outside of where the industry usually looks. ? She also seemed absolutely delighted to have won. Isn?t this what we want from an acceptance speech? A little humor, a bit of thoughtfulness, some seemingly true human emotion.  ?   Margaret Lyons Read more about Tracee Ellis Ross?s speech. It?s time to retire ?Sofia Vergara is not a native English speaker? as a comic premise. She came out and said ?anal? twice and then ?anus,? the big joke being that she can?t pronounce ?annual. ?  ?   Margaret Lyons Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig?s introduction for best animated feature was hilarious. And thank God  ?   the otherwise abysmal banter segments were draining every iota of energy out of the ceremony.  ?   Margaret Lyons The actors who really stole the show were, for the most part, under the age of 15: the kids from ?Stranger Things? and Sunny Pawar, the   Indian actor who played a lost child in ?Lion. ? The ?Stranger Things? boys  ?   Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp  ?   arrived together, charming the red carpet  with their sharp outfits and snappy moves. Caleb later grabbed a selfie with Ryan Gosling during a commercial break. And onstage during the show, when Sunny was hoisted up to the mic by Dev Patel, who plays the older version of their character in the drama ?Lion,? the entire ballroom erupted in awws and coos, the sound of hundreds of hearts melting.  ?

17538;Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman;10/01/2017;2017;1;business;WASHINGTON  ?   Jared Kushner will become a senior White House adviser to his    Donald J. Trump, cementing the New York real estate executive?s role as a powerful and at times decisive influence on the  . Mr. Kushner, 35, who married Mr. Trump?s daughter Ivanka in 2009, is closer to Mr. Trump than any other adviser, a steady and stabilizing presence inside an often chaotic transition team who has provided input on most of his   ?s most consequential hiring and firing decisions. Mr. Trump described Mr. Kushner as ?a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition? in a statement issued early Monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern. Mr. Kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets, his lawyer said. Some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal   laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government. Other presidents configured their White House hierarchies to mirror experiences in statehouses, on campaigns or at the heads of armies. Mr. Trump intends to adopt the management style of a New York real estate empire, with family at the pinnacle and staff members, however trusted or talented, somewhere below. Ms. Trump, who also participated in her father?s campaign decisions, has no immediate plans to enter the administration and will restructure her portfolio of holdings. But she plans to step down from the management of the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, said Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. Kushner?s lawyer. Mr. Kushner?s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who added that she had been consulting with federal ethics officials in an attempt to minimize opposition to Mr. Kushner?s appointment. Under the arrangement, Mr. Kushner will divest his holdings in his family real estate firm?s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue sell his stake in the New York Observer newspaper divest his interest in his brother?s firm, Thrive Capital and restructure other investments. He will also divest of all foreign investments, said Ms. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. He will have to recuse himself on matters that could relate to his wife?s businesses and his remaining holdings, she added. Mr. Kushner has been described by numerous transition staff members as the first among equals in Mr. Trump?s high command. His new title belies the sweeping influence he will have behind the scenes. The   Mr. Kushner has often been described as having a calming effect on Mr. Trump, who is notorious for yelling at staff members during moments of tension. Mr. Kushner became the de facto campaign manager in the spring, and his influence with Mr. Trump has expanded rapidly. He is expected to play the same role in the White House, while the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, provides the   with strategic, messaging and communications advice, and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and the incoming chief of staff, runs    operations in the West Wing. Mr. Trump?s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, will have a direct line to the president on a range of issues. Despite his lack of   political experience before the 2016 campaign, Mr. Kushner earned the trust of his mercurial    during the campaign?s most turbulent moments, joining his wife and Mr. Trump?s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. in ousting Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager, in the heat of the primary season. Mr. Kushner was among those who pushed, campaign officials said, for the removal of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of Mr. Trump?s transition team, and pressed for his    to appoint David M. Friedman, a Long Island lawyer, as ambassador to Israel. Mr. Kushner, an orthodox Jew, has also made an unlikely ally of Mr. Bannon, an icon of the   nationalist movement. When Mr. Bannon, a former Breitbart executive, came under attack from Democrats after he was appointed to a White House role, Mr. Kushner assured allies that he had complete faith in Mr. Bannon and described him as a man of character. Mr. Kushner will not take a salary and plans to work on issues involving the Middle East and Israel try to forge government partnerships with the private sector and collaborate with Mr. Trump?s choice for commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. on matters involving free trade, Ms. Gorelick said. The scion of a prominent Democratic family active in New Jersey politics, Mr. Kushner showed few early signs that he would become a national political power player. A Harvard graduate, he is a lifelong Democrat, liberal on social issues. Like his ideologically limber    he has donated to Democratic candidates. Mr. Kushner?s appointment was greeted with relief by some liberals, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who views him as moderating influence in a Trump West Wing dominated by   conservatives. ?I respect him a lot,? Mr. de Blasio said when asked about Mr. Kushner on Monday. ?I?ve known him for years and find him to be a very reasonable person. ? Still, it remains unclear if Mr. Kushner is inclined to prod the   to the left. By his own account, he underwent something of a personal political transformation during the campaign, embracing Mr. Trump?s fiery and conservative economic message after spending months crisscrossing red and   America. Mr. Kushner?s new role became public a day after the disclosure that he would resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family?s real estate firm, and divest himself of ?substantial assets,? including 666 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Kushner will divest of his holdings in The Observer and has stepped down as its publisher his    the newspaper?s chairman, will assume that role. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday to discuss his plans for dealing with myriad conflicts of interest raised by his sprawling international development, hotel, branding and entertainment empire. Ms. Gorelick said she was confident Mr. Kushner?s appointment would survive any legal challenge, and said Mr. Trump would seek an advisory opinion from the Department of Justice?s Office of Legal Counsel. ?I am not saying there?s no legal argument on the other side,? she added. ?I?m just saying we have the better argument and will prevail. ? Mr. Trump made it clear since he was elected that he wanted Mr. Kushner in his White House. Since December, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Gorelick?s team have consulted with the Office of Government Ethics to create a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements needed for him to serve. Mr. Kushner?s father, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was once imprisoned for tax evasion, will take an increased role in the family company. Norman L. Eisen, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, said he thought Mr. Kushner?s decision to divest holdings raised pressure on Mr. Trump to follow suit. ?What we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the Trump transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law,? he said. ?Rex Tillerson has retired from Exxon, and now Kushner is doing the same,? he added, referring to Mr. Trump?s nominee for secretary of state. ?So it?s going to be hard for Trump to ignore 40 years of precedent and not do the same. ?;;;;
17548;Tatiana Schlossberg and John Schwartz;11/01/2017;2017;1;politics;The Obama administration, rushing to secure its environmental legacy, has increased protection for a humble bumblebee. The   bumblebee, once common across the continental United States, has been designated an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service: the country?s first bumblebee, and the first bee from the lower 48 states, to be added to the register. Seven bees were previously listed as endangered, but they are found only in Hawaii. Since the late 1990s, the population of the   bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent, a result of a combination of factors, including exposure to pesticides, climate change, habitat loss and disease, federal wildlife officials said. The species, once found in 28 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces, is found today only in small pockets of its   habitat. The designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees? habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them. It is the latest in a flurry of   efforts to protect the environment and preserve President Obama?s legacy on climate change. In the last month, he has issued a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large areas of the Arctic and much of the Eastern Seaboard announced two new national monuments in Utah and Nevada, protecting 1. 65 million acres of federal land and denied six permits for oil exploration in the Atlantic, partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals. And the announcement about the bee came a day after the Fish and Wildlife Service said that   climate change is the biggest threat to the polar bear?s survival, and that without significant action to fight global warming, the bears will most likely vanish. Federal wildlife officials noted that the process of listing a species as endangered can take years, sometimes even decades. More than 300 species have been listed during the Obama administration, second only to the more than 500 species listed under President Bill Clinton. During the George W. Bush administration, just 62 species were added to the list. Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, said activists were worried ?that we?re headed into another period like that, where hostility from the administration toward protecting endangered species causes them to shut the listing program down. ? The incoming Trump administration, however, would need to undertake a lengthy process to declare the   bumblebee population recovered if it wished to reverse this week?s decision, and it would be required by law to justify its action on scientific grounds. The role of these bees and other   insects is important, Tom Melius, the Fish and Wildlife Service?s Midwest regional director, said in a statement. ?Pollinators are small but mighty parts of the natural mechanism that sustains us and our world,? he said. ?Without them, our forests, parks, meadows and shrub lands, and the abundant, vibrant life they support, cannot survive, and our crops require laborious, costly pollination by hand. ? Around the world, the populations of bees, butterflies and other insects that promote plant growth are crashing, a threat not only to biodiversity but also to the global food supply. A study last year from a group associated with the United Nations warned that an increasing number of species that aid the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars? worth of food each year face extinction. ?Obviously, it?s sad that anything has to get on the endangered list, but this really provides a great opportunity,? said Dennis vanEngelsdorp of the University of Maryland, a bee expert who applauded the government?s decision. ?When you?re talking about saving the bumblebees, what you?re really talking about is saving the community. ? The kinds of measures that could protect the   bumblebee could help many other pollinators, as well, by restoring habitats and food sources and restricting the use of pesticides  ?   especially   insecticides that have been linked to the decline in bee species. Such measures are especially important with native bumblebees, Dr. vanEngelsdorp noted, as opposed to honeybees, which are maintained in large colonies and trucked around the country for commercial pollination. The service is reviewing three other species of bees to determine whether they ought to be listed as endangered as well: Franklin?s bumblebee, the western bumblebee and the   bumblebee. When a species is listed as endangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to design a recovery plan, which is often carried out by other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities and tribes. Other federal agencies have to check that their actions will not hurt an endangered species or its habitat, particularly when it comes to land use planning. Bumblebees are particularly effective pollinators because, though they seem to prefer native flowers, they will pollinate pretty much anything and can fly in lower temperatures and lower light conditions than many other insects. They also use the technique of ?buzz pollination,? in which they grab the   part of the flower in their jaws and vibrate their wings, shaking the pollen loose, a process that seems to benefit plants like tomatoes, peppers and cranberries, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Bumblebees are particularly important to agriculture, but agriculture is often unkind to them. A number of factors have reduced the habitat available to bees, including the use of pesticides and other chemicals, the domination of vast amounts of farmland by a single crop, and the use of some genetically modified crops and herbicides that prevent the growth of weeds in fields and wildflowers along their borders. Climate change may also be shrinking the bees? habitat, because of drought, rising temperatures, more storms and mismatches in timing: Plants may start to flower at times when the bees are not ready to pollinate. It also presents serious threats to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies and other pollinators, such as honeybees. While these species may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bears or other mammals whose existences are threatened by a changing climate, placing them on the endangered list is a victory for the species and those who fight for it. ?Now we have a symbol to rally around,? Dr. vanEngelsdorp said.;;;;
17563;Matthew Rosenberg;12/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   The good news for Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas,   Donald J. Trump?s nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, is that he appears to share the same adversarial view of Russia as most American spies. The bad news for Mr. Pompeo is that he will have to square his views with those of Mr. Trump, who has denigrated American intelligence agencies, praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and is now contending with a dossier of unsubstantiated reports that Russia has collected compromising and salacious personal information about him. Known as a pugnacious Republican  partisan by his colleagues in Congress, Mr. Pompeo is going to have pull off the political balancing act of his career to keep the confidence of the Trump White House while winning over the C. I. A. an agency that is notoriously hostile to outsiders in the best of times. His Senate confirmation hearing, scheduled for Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee, will be the first test of whether he has the diplomatic finesse to manage it. Mr. Trump?s aides will no doubt be keeping close watch for any signs that they cannot rely on Mr. Pompeo, while Democrats on the committee will be eager to look for any daylight between the nominee and Mr. Trump. That will be especially true when it comes to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to undermine American democracy and promote the candidacy of Mr. Trump. At the C. I. A. the concerns are more parochial. The message officials will be looking to hear from Mr. Pompeo is, ?I?m going to protect you from these guys,? said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency. ?Every television set in Langley is going to be on for that hearing,? Mr. Hayden said, referring to the town in Northern Virginia where the C. I. A. is based. Mr. Trump?s mocking response to accusations that Russia meddled in the election has opened an extraordinary breach between an incoming president and the C. I. A. and the revelation that intelligence chiefs briefed Mr. Trump last week on the dossier of unsubstantiated reports is likely to deepen the divide. The dispute has hit morale hard at the C. I. A. current and former agency officials said. At his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that intelligence agencies were ?vital? and that they would have 90 days after his inauguration to produce ?a major report on hacking. ? But he also continued to criticize the agencies, suggesting that they had leaked the dossier. It was ?disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,? he said. The C. I. A. considers its mission to provide cleareyed information and analysis that is free of political interference, and it considers the president its main customer. It is sensitive to slights, and many at the C. I. A. were especially galled by what they considered Mr. Trump?s cheap shots at the mistaken intelligence in the prelude to the Iraq war. ?It prides itself on being the president?s agency, so how does that feel when your patron suddenly is dumping all over your work,? said Mark M. Lowenthal, a former C. I. A. analyst. Memories run long at the C. I. A. and hanging over the dispute with Mr. Trump is the unhappy tenure of Porter J. Goss, the last sitting member of Congress named to lead the agency. Mr. Goss took over in 2004, when the agency was widely viewed as being at odds with the Bush administration over the Iraq war, and his marching orders were to end what the White House viewed as a campaign of leaks by insiders who opposed administration policies. Mr. Goss failed to stop the leaks. But his attempted crackdown, which included rare ? ? polygraph tests of senior officials, prompted a wave of departures by veterans. Mr. Goss lasted only 13 months, done in by the spreading discontent with his leadership. Mr. Pompeo has not made any public comments since his nomination in November, and how he will approach his new job remains to be seen. He is best known for his relentless questioning of Hillary Clinton during the congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. His quips about the attack being worse than Watergate and his continued insistence that there was a ?? even after the House Select Committee on Benghazi found no new evidence of wrongdoing, have raised some concerns about such an overt partisan leading an agency that is supposed to be above politics. But among both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, Mr. Pompeo, a former Army tank officer who graduated first in his class from West Point, is widely seen as smart and thorough  ?   and a professional who is capable of rising above the political fray. ?He really enjoys this type of work, so I think he?s going to flourish,? said Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from California. ?He?s a military guy, an academy graduate, and this is what he?s been working for his whole career. ? At the C. I. A. there was a sense that Mr. Pompeo?s nomination signaled an end to Mr. Trump?s   dismissals of accusations about Russian meddling, and a readiness to start taking intelligence seriously. A new administration often brings an infusion of energy and ideas, and most at the agency are eager to get to work under Mr. Pompeo, according to a current C. I. A. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they could not be quoted by name. But there are already suggestions from some corners of the Trump camp about a need to reorganize the intelligence community, which has stoked concerns at the C. I. A. of a ?hostile takeover? by leaders who want political cheerleading, not cleareyed analysis, Mr. Lowenthal said. How Mr. Pompeo gets along with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump?s choice for national security adviser, is likely to prove crucial. Mr. Flynn, a retired intelligence officer and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is a harsh judge of the C. I. A. which he says was overly politicized by the Obama administration. That view is not widely shared by Republicans or Democrats in Washington. But it appears to have been internalized by Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Pompeo?s hawkish views on a range of other issues are likely to be welcomed at the agency. He has argued for Congress to permit domestic surveillance on a huge scale, says waterboarding is legal and does not constitute torture, and views Russia as the biggest threat facing the United States. ?I think it?s safe to say that Mr. Pompeo is very skeptical of Vladimir Putin,? Mr. Nunes said. ?I don?t think you can get any more concerned about Putin?s advancement? than Mr. Pompeo. Democrats expect to hit the Russia issue hard in an attempt to draw out differences between Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Trump. But they are also looking for Mr. Pompeo to take clear stances on controversial issues where he has made statements that put him in line with the   like waterboarding and domestic surveillance. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he expected Mr. Pompeo to try to avoid being pinned down, especially on matters on which he may disagree with Mr. Trump, by saying that the director of the C. I. A. does not set policy but only executes it. Mr. Pompeo took that tack in his written responses to questions from some senators on the intelligence committee, Senator Wyden said. ?I?m going to be respectfully saying that?s a lot of baloney,? he added. As director of the C. I. A. Mr. Pompeo would ?have an enormous effect on surveillance and torture and Russia,? Senator Wyden said. ?The American people want policies that are going to better produce security and liberty. ? The Trump team is ?advancing ideas that give us less of both. ?;;;;
17570;Michael Forsythe and Chris Buckley;12/01/2017;2017;1;politics;HONG KONG  ?   Taiwan scrambled   fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after China sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwan?s official Central News Agency reported. The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after   Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwan?s president, Tsai   after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan?s formal independence from China. Ms. Tsai, who is visiting Central America this week, made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoning?s transit, the Central News Agency reported, citing Alex Huang, the president?s spokesman. China?s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump. ?It?s a show of force, and I think it is intended in part to intimidate, and that?s worrisome from the U. S. and Taiwan?s point of view because we don?t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions,? said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ?If the Trump administration does see this as a test of U. S. resolve, I suspect they?ll push back pretty forcefully. ? China sent the carrier, which had been conducting exercises in the South China Sea, into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning. Taiwan?s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan. Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separately since 1949, when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang   fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists. China views any assertion of Taiwan?s separateness from the mainland  ?   like Ms. Tsai?s call with Mr. Trump  ?   as an affront to its claim of sovereignty. Since 1979, the United States has recognized the government in Beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to Taiwan as part of the One China policy. In the wake of the   call, China warned the incoming president against making changes to that policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. Liu Zhenmin, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the Taiwan Strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the Liaoning to pass though it. The passage would not have any effect on   relations, he said in remarks carried in the Chinese news media. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington in response to a question about the Liaoning?s passage through the strait that the United States ?wouldn?t have a problem? with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law. It also was not the first time the Liaoning had sailed through the strait: It passed through in November 2013 on its way to the South China Sea after having been commissioned only the year before. In that instance, the carrier kept to the western half of the strait, closer to mainland China. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Taiwan?s Defense Ministry said that the Liaoning was also staying to the west of the strait?s middle and urged citizens to remain calm. A transit on the eastern side, closer to Taiwan, would be viewed as much more provocative. Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said that for the Chinese, traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline. In order for warships based in northern ports, like the Liaoning, to return home from southern waters, they must either pass close to Japanese islands or transit the Taiwan Strait. ?Geography forces a very binary choice,? he said. Mr. Graham said it was important to see how the Liaoning conducted its passage. If it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations, that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay, he said. The Liaoning, commissioned in 2012 and built from a Soviet hull, is China?s first aircraft carrier. In past decades, the United States has shown its resolve to defend Taiwan by sailing carriers through the Taiwan Strait. In 1995, the aircraft carrier Nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after Beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters. China?s military   is highly secretive, but it would seem inconceivable for the Liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president, Xi Jinping, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the military. And the Chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying Mr. Xi?s plans for a stronger navy, capable of projecting force far beyond China?s territorial waters. Last Thursday, the front page of People?s Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, featured a report about the aircraft carrier?s latest journey under the headline, ?We?re sailing under the leader?s attentive gaze,? a clear tribute to Mr. Xi. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the Liaoning?s passage was part of the ship?s scheduled training in the western Pacific, which had begun on Dec. 24. Mr. Ma also said that the   relationship in the coming year would face ?increasing uncertainty, looming risks and challenges. ? He added that Taiwan?s government and ?independence forces? there had ?seriously threatened the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,? accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that China would ?resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. ? The aircraft carrier?s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the Chinese military that have raised hackles in the region. Last month, a Chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the United States Navy about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The drone was returned after the Obama administration publicly chided China over the seizure. On Monday, Japan said it had sent fighter jets into the air after Chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. ?When China was militarily weaker, Japan considered that area to be its backyard,? said Ni Lexiong, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. ?This was a way of telling Japan that if there ever is conflict, the location of any future battle space won?t be decided by you and America. We have the initiative. So Japan, don?t think of meddling further afield in Taiwan or the South China Sea. ?;;;;
17579;Margot Sanger-Katz;15/06/2017;2017;6;lifestyle;You may know there?s added sugar in your Coke or cookies. But did you know that it?s in your salad dressing, pasta sauce and bread? The Food and Drug Administration came out Friday with its new template for nutrition labels. One big change was the addition of a line for ?added sugar,? to be placed below a line for total sugar. The change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food  ?   like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt  ?   and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors  ?   like the ?evaporated cane juice? in a Chobani Kids strawberry yogurt. A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar. When they looked at every individual processed food in the store, 68 percent had added sugar. Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods, but not all. The list includes many sauces, soups, fruit juices and even meat products. You might think it?s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food, but it isn?t always so. While some foods include ?sugar? in their ingredients, many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar. Most of us have heard of   corn syrup, a sugar made from processing corn. But there are also things like the ?evaporated cane juice? in the yogurt, and ?rice syrup? and ?? which are less obvious and amount to the same thing. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, and one of the paper?s authors, said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers. Instead, he said, the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture. Some sugars are better for baked goods, while others are better in soft drinks. Some are also cheaper than others. Sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar. But not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws? quotas. There?s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates, which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated. A lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like ?apple juice concentrate. ? That?s sugar. That will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated. ?It?s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores, when they find that all this natural food they?ve been buying is full of added sugar,? Mr. Popkin said. ?It?s full of fruit juice concentrates, and they thought it was all good stuff. ? The emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge Americans to consume a ?healthy dietary pattern? containing certain types of foods. According to the regulation, hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern. Medical evidence shows that high sugar consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay  ?   though not all of that work distinguishes between added sugar and total sugar. Many of the big food industry trade groups and lobbyists were satisfied with the new label rules, as my colleague Sabrina Tavernise recently wrote. But the sugar industry and the corn refiners are upset. Critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful, and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak. The new label will kick in for large food companies in 2018, and for smaller companies a year later. The U. N. C. research used its master list of sugar code words to measure how many grocery store foods include sugar. But measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult. Mr. Popkin said consumers would be surprised by recent research from his team revealing the large amounts of added sugars in products that are generally thought of as healthy  ?   foods like infant formula, protein bars and yogurt.;;;;
17588;Jon Mooallem;15/01/2017;2017;1;lifestyle;Joachim Neander was a   Calvinist theologian who often hiked through a valley outside Dsseldorf, Germany, writing hymns. Neander understood everything around him as a manifestation of the Lord?s will and work. There was no room in his worldview for randomness, only purpose and praise. ?See how God this rolling   with beauty as a robe,? one of his verses goes. ?Forests, fields, and living   its Master?s glory sings. ? He wrote dozens of hymns like this  ?     and  . Then he caught tuberculosis and died at 30. Almost two centuries later, in the summer of 1856, workers quarrying limestone in that valley dug up an unusual skull. It was elongated and almost chinless, and the fossilized bones found alongside it were extra thick and fit together oddly. This was three years before Darwin published ?The Origin of Species. ? The science of human origins was not a science the assumption was that our ancestors had always looked like us, all the way back to Adam. (Even distinguishing fossils from ordinary rock was beyond the grasp of many scientists. One popular method involved licking them if the material had animal matter in it, it stuck to your tongue.) And so, as anomalous as these German bones seemed, most scholars had no trouble finding satisfying explanations. A leading theory held that this was the skeleton of a lost, bowlegged Cossack with rickets. The peculiar bony ridge over the man?s eyes was a result of the poor Cossack?s perpetually furrowing his brow in pain  ?   because of the rickets. One British geologist, William King, suspected something more radical. Instead of being the remains of an atypical human, they might have belonged to a typical member of an alternate humanity. In 1864, he published a paper introducing it as such  ?   an extinct human species, the first ever discovered. King named this species after the valley where it was found, which itself had been named for the ecstatic poet who once wandered it. He called it Homo neanderthalensis: Neanderthal Man. Who was Neanderthal Man? King felt obligated to describe him. But with no established techniques for interpreting archaeological material like the skull, he fell back on racism and phrenology. He focused on the peculiarities of the Neanderthal?s skull, including the ?enormously projecting brow. ? No living humans had skeletal features remotely like these, but King was under the impression that the skulls of contemporary African and Australian aboriginals resembled the Neanderthals? more than ?ordinary?   skulls. So extrapolating from his low opinion of what he called these ?savage? races, he explained that the Neanderthal?s skull alone was proof of its moral ?darkness? and stupidity. ?The thoughts and desires which once dwelt within it never soared beyond those of a brute,? he wrote. Other scientists piled on. So did the popular press. We knew almost nothing about Neanderthals, but already we assumed they were ogres and losers. The genesis of this idea, the historian Paige Madison notes, largely comes down to flukes of ?timing and luck. ? While King was working, another British scientist, George Busk, had the same suspicions about the Neander skull. He had received a comparable one, too, from the tiny British territory of Gibraltar. The Gibraltar skull was dug up long before the Neander Valley specimen surfaced, but local hobbyists simply labeled it ?human skull? and forgot about it for the next 16 years. Its brow ridge wasn?t as prominent as the Neander skull?s, and its features were less imposing it was a woman?s skull, it turns out. Busk dashed off a quick report but stopped short of naming the new creature. He hoped to study additional fossils and learn more. Privately, he considered calling it Homo calpicus, or Gibraltar Man. So, what if Busk  ?   ?a conscientious naturalist too cautious to make premature claims,? as Madison describes him  ?   had beaten King to publication? Consider how different our first impressions of a Gibraltar Woman might have been from those of Neanderthal Man: what feelings of sympathy, or even kinship, this other skull might have stirred. There is a worldview, the opposite of Joachim Neander?s, that sees our planet as a product of only tumult and indifference. In such a world, it?s possible for an entire species to be ground into extinction by forces beyond its control and then, 40, 000 years later, be dug up and made to endure an additional century and a half of bad luck and abuse. That?s what happened to the Neanderthals. And it?s what we did to them. But recently, after we?d snickered over their skulls for so long, it stopped being clear who the boneheads were. I?ll start with a confession, an embarrassing but relevant one, because I would come to see our history with Neanderthals as continually distorted by an unfortunate human tendency to believe in ideas that are, in reality, incorrect  ?   and then to leverage that conviction into a feeling of superiority over other people. And in retrospect, I realize I demonstrated that same tendency myself at the beginning of this project. Because I don?t want to come off as   or as pointing fingers, here goes: Before traveling to Gibraltar last summer, I had no idea what Gibraltar was. Or rather, I was sure I knew what Gibraltar was, but I was wrong. I thought it was just that famous Rock  ?   an unpopulated hunk of   geology, which, if I?m being honest, I recognized mostly from the Prudential logo: that limestone protuberance at the mouth of the Mediterranean, that elephantine white molar jutting into the sky. True, I was traveling to Gibraltar on short notice when I   the director of the Gibraltar Museum, Clive Finlayson, he told me the museum happened to be starting its annual excavation of a Neanderthal cave there the following week and invited me to join. Still, even a couple of days before I left, when a friend told me she faintly remembered spending an afternoon in Gibraltar once as a teenager, I gently mansplained to her that I was pretty sure she was mistaken: Gibraltar, I told her, wasn?t somewhere you could just go. In my mind, I had privileged access. I pictured myself and Finlayson taking a special little boat. In fact, Gibraltar is a peninsula connected to Spain. It?s a lively British overseas territory, with 30, 000 citizens living in a city on its western side  ?   a city with bakeries and clothing stores and tourists buying all the usual kitsch. Some unusual kitsch, too  ?   like a laminated child?s place mat I spotted that, in a typical tourist destination, might say something unexceptional like SOMEONE WHO LOVES ME WENT TO GIBRALTAR, but here read WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER! BRITISH FOREVER! The history of Gibraltar, given its strategic location, is a grinding saga of military sieges and ruthlessly contested changes in ownership. The residue of that strife, today, is a pronounced British patriotism and a   exchange of slights with Spain, which still disputes Britain?s claim to the territory. After Queen Elizabeth II?s Diamond Jubilee, in 2012, when Gibraltar projected towering images of Her Majesty on a   side of the Rock  ?   ?a clear act of provocation,? one reporter called it  ?   Spain began inspecting vehicle after vehicle at the border, backing up the line for hours, stranding the bulk of Gibraltar?s work force, who commute in every day. The afternoon I showed up, activists from a   Spanish political party had crossed into Gibraltar and hung an enormous Spanish flag high up on the Rock. This wasn?t just mischief. It was regarded as an act of symbolic terrorism. When one of the men appeared in court two days later, I read, a woman screamed at him, ?Gibraltar will never be Spanish!? She sounded like that defiant place mat come to life. I happened to arrive in Gibraltar the week of the Brexit vote. Up in England, people were thundering about the working class versus elites, sovereignty and immigration, warning that British identity was being fouled by the European project. But in Gibraltar  ?   a   fully detached nib of Britain, flanked by water on two sides and Spain on the third  ?   the question was less philosophical: If the United Kingdom left the European Union, Spain might seize the opportunity to isolate Gibraltar, leaving the territory to shrivel up, like a flap of dead skin. The Gibraltarian government had already called on the House of Commons for help. There was concern that Spain would jam up the border again and that it might happen right away. Around town, ?Remain? signs hung everywhere. The atmosphere was edgy, as though everyone was holding hands, waiting to see whether a meteor would hit. It was like the hairline cracks between so many     and Thems seemed to be widening, and some corrosive, molten goop was seeping out: mutual dependence curdled with contempt. Clearly it was happening back home in America too. All in all, it was a good week to spend in a cave. Gorham?s Cave is on Gibraltar?s   eastern coast: a tremendous opening at the bottom of the sheer face of the Rock, shadowy and   like a cathedral. Its mouth is 200 feet across at the base and 120 feet tall. It tapers asymmetrically like a crumpled wizard?s hat. Neanderthals inhabited Gorham?s Cave on and off for 100, 000 years, as well as a second cave next to it, called Vanguard Cave. The artifacts they left behind were buried as wind pushed sand into the cave. This created a high sloping dune, composed of hundreds of distinct layers of sand, each of which was once the surface of the dune, the floor of the cave. The dune is enormous. It reaches about   of the way up Gorham?s walls, spilling out of the cave?s mouth and onto the rocky beach, like a colossal cat?s tongue lapping at the Mediterranean. Every summer, since 1989, a team of archaeologists has returned to meticulously clear that sand away and recover the material inside. ?I realized a long time ago, I won?t live to see the end of this project,? Finlayson, who leads the excavation, told me. ?But I think we?re in a great moment. We?re beginning to understand these people after a century of putting them down as apelike brutes. ? Neanderthals are people, too  ?   a separate,   branch of our family tree. We last shared an ancestor at some point between 500, 000 and 750, 000 years ago. Then our evolutionary trajectory split. We evolved in Africa, while the Neanderthals would live in Europe and Asia for 300, 000 years. Or as little as 60, 000 years. It depends whom you ask. It always does: The study of human origins, I found, is riddled with vehement disagreements and scientists who readily dismantle the premises of even the most   questions. (In this case, the uncertainty rests, in part, on when, in this long evolutionary process, Neanderthals officially became ?Neanderthals. ?) What is clearer is that roughly 40, 000 years ago, just as our own lineage expanded from Africa and took over Eurasia, the Neanderthals disappeared. Scientists have always assumed that the timing wasn?t coincidental. Maybe we used our superior intellects to outcompete the Neanderthals for resources maybe we clubbed them all to death. Whatever the mechanism of this   replacement, it seemed to imply that our kind was somehow better than their kind. We?re still here, after all, and their path ended as soon as we crossed paths. But Neanderthals weren?t the   louts we?ve imagined them to be  ?   not just a bunch of Neanderthals. As a review of findings published last year put it, they were actually ?very similar? to their contemporary Homo sapiens in Africa, in terms of ?standard markers of modern cognitive and behavioral capacities. ? We?ve always classified Neanderthals, technically, as human  ?   part of the genus Homo. But it turns out they also did the stuff that, you know, makes us human. Neanderthals buried their dead. They made jewelry and specialized tools. They made ocher and other pigments, perhaps to paint their faces or bodies  ?   evidence of a ?symbolically mediated worldview,? as archaeologists call it. Their tracheal anatomy suggests that they were capable of language and probably had   raspy voices, like Julia Child. They manufactured glue from birch bark, which required heating the bark to at least 644 degrees Fahrenheit  ?   a feat scientists find difficult to duplicate without a ceramic container. In Gibraltar, there?s evidence that Neanderthals extracted the feathers of certain birds  ?   only dark feathers  ?   possibly for aesthetic or ceremonial purposes. And while Neanderthals were once presumed to be crude scavengers, we now know they exploited the different terrains on which they lived. They took down dangerous game, including an extinct species of rhinoceros. Some ate seals and other marine mammals. Some ate shellfish. Some ate chamomile. (They had regional cuisines.) They used toothpicks. Wearing feathers, eating seals  ?   maybe none of this sounds particularly impressive. But it?s what our human ancestors were capable of back then too, and scientists have always considered such behavioral flexibility and complexity as signs of our specialness. When it came to Neanderthals, though, many researchers literally couldn?t see the evidence sitting in front of them. A lot of the new thinking about Neanderthals comes from revisiting material in museum collections, excavated decades ago, and   it with new technology or simply with open minds. The real surprise of these discoveries may not be the competence of Neanderthals but how obnoxiously low our expectations for them have been  ?   the bias with which too many scientists approached that other Us. One archaeologist called these researchers ?modern human supremacists. ? Inside Gorham?s Cave, archaeologists were excavating what they called a hearth  ?   not a physical fireplace but a spot in the sand where, around 50, 000 years ago, Neanderthals lit a fire. Each summer, the Gibraltar Museum employs students from universities in England and Spain to work the dig, and now two young women  ?   one from each country  ?   sat   under work lights, clearing sand away with the edge of a trowel and a brush to leave a   cube. A black band of charcoal ran through it. The students worked scrupulously, watching for small animal bones or artifacts. They?d pulled out a butchered ibex mandible, a number of mollusk shells and   husks. They?d also found six chunks of fossilized hyena dung, as well as ?d?bitage,? distinctive shards of flint left over when Neanderthals shattered larger pieces to make axes. The cube of sand would eventually be wrapped in plaster and sent for analysis. The sand the two women were sweeping into their dustpans was transferred into plastic bags and marched out of the cave, down to the beach, where other students sieved it. Smaller bones caught in the sieve were bagged and labeled. Even the sand that passed through the sieve was saved and driven back to a lab at the museum, where I would later find three other students picking through it with magnifying glasses and tweezers, searching for tinier stuff  ?   rodent teeth,   spines  ?   while listening to ?Call Me Maybe. ? To an outsider, it looked preposterous. The archaeologists were cataloging and storing absolutely everything, treating this physical material as though it were digital information  ?   JPEGs of itself. And yet they couldn?t afford not to: Everything a Neanderthal came into contact with was a valuable clue. (In 28 years of excavations here, archaeologists have yet to find a fossil of an actual Neanderthal.) ?This is like putting together a   jigsaw puzzle where you only have five pieces,? Finlayson said. He somehow made this analogy sound exciting instead of hopeless. By that point, the enormousness of what they didn?t know  ?   what they could never know  ?   had become a distraction for me. One of the dig?s lead archaeologists, Richard Jennings of Liverpool John Moores University, listed the many items they had found around that hearth. ?And this is literally just from two squares!? he said. (A ?square,? in archaeology, is one meter by one meter sites are divided into grids of squares.) Then Jennings waved wordlessly at the rest of the   cave. Look at the big picture, he was saying imagine what else we?ll find! There was also Vanguard Cave next door, an even more promising site, because while Gorham?s had been partly excavated by less meticulous scientists in the 1940s and ?50s, Finlayson?s team was the first to touch Vanguard. Already they had uncovered a layer of perfectly preserved mud there. (?We suspect, if there?s a place where you?re going to find the first Neanderthal footprint, it will be here,? Finlayson said.) The ?resolution? of the caves was incredible the wind blew sand in so fast that it preserved short periods, faithfully, like entries in a diary. Finlayson has described it as ?the longest and most detailed record of [Neanderthals?] way of life that is currently available. ? This was the good news. And yet there were more than 20 other nearby caves that the Gibraltar Neanderthals might have used, and they were now underwater, behind us. When sea levels rose around 20, 000 years ago, the Mediterranean drowned them. It also drowned the wooded savanna between Gorham?s and the former coastline  ?   where, presumably, the Neanderthals had spent an even larger share of their lives and left even more artifacts. So yes, Jennings was right: There was a lot of cave left to dig through. But it was like looking for needles in a haystack, and the entire haystack was merely the one needle they had managed to find in an astronomically larger haystack. And most of that haystack was now inaccessible forever. I could tell it wasn?t productive to dwell on the problem at this scale, while picking   husks from the hearth, but there it was. ?Look, you can almost see what?s happening,? Finlayson eventually said. ?The fire and the charcoal, the embers scattering. ? It was true. If you followed that stratum of sand away from the hearth, you could see, embedded in the wall behind us, black flecks where the smoke and cinders from this fire had blown. Suddenly, it struck me  ?   though it should have earlier  ?   that what we were looking at were the remnants of a single event: a specific fire, on a specific night, made by specific Neanderthals. Maybe this won?t sound that profound, but it snapped that prehistoric abstraction into focus. This wasn?t just a ?hearth,? I realized it was a campfire. Finlayson began narrating the scene for me. A few Neanderthals cooked the ibex they had hunted and the mussels and nuts they had foraged and then, after dinner, made some tools around the fire. After they went to sleep and the fire died out, a hyena slinked in to scavenge scraps from the ashes and took a poop. Then  ?   perhaps that same night  ?   the wind picked up and covered everything with the fine layer of sand that these students were now brushing away. While we stood talking, one of the women uncovered a small flint ax, called a Levallois flake. After 50, 000 years, the edge was still sharp. They let me touch it. One of the earliest authorities on Neanderthals was a Frenchman named Marcellin Boule. A lot of what he said was wrong. In 1911, Boule began publishing his analysis of the first nearly complete Neanderthal skeleton ever discovered, which he named Old Man of La Chapelle, after the limestone cave where it was found. Laboring to reconstruct the Old Man?s anatomy, he deduced that its head must have been slouched forward, its spine hunched and its toes spread like an ape?s. Then, having reassembled the Neanderthal this way, Boule insulted it. This ?brutish? and ?clumsy? posture, he wrote, clearly indicated a lack of morals and a lifestyle dominated by ?functions of a purely vegetative or bestial kind. ? A colleague of Boule?s went further, claiming that Neanderthals usually walked on all fours and never laughed: ?  had no smile. ? Boule was part of a movement trying to reconcile natural selection with religion by portraying Neanderthals as closer to animals than to us, he could protect the ideal of a separate, immaculate human lineage. When he consulted with an artist to make a rendering of the Neanderthal, it came out looking like a furry, mean gorilla. Neanderthal fossils kept surfacing in Europe, and scholars like Boule were scrambling to make sense of them, improvising what would later grow into a new interdisciplinary field, now known as paleoanthropology. The evolution of that science was haphazard and often comically unscientific. An exhaustive history by Erik Trinkaus and Pat Shipman describes how Neanderthals became ?mirrors that reflected, in all their awfulness and awesomeness, the nature and humanity of those who touched them. ? That included a lot of human blundering. It became clear only in 1957, for example  ?   46 years after Boule, and after several   of the Old Man?s skeleton  ?   that Boule?s particular Neanderthal, which led him to imagine all Neanderthals as   oafs, actually just had several deforming injuries and severe osteoarthritis. Still, Boule?s influence was  . Over the years, his ideologically tainted image of Neanderthals was often refracted through the lens of other ideologies, occasionally racist ones. In 1930, the prominent British anthropologist Sir Arthur Keith, writing in The New York Times, channeled Boule?s work to justify colonialism. For Keith, the replacement of an ancient, inferior species like Neanderthals by newer, heartier Homo sapiens proved that Britain?s actions in Australia  ?   ?The white man . .. replacing the most ancient type of brown man known to us?  ?   was part of a natural order that had been operating for millenniums. It?s easy to get snooty about all this unenlightened paleoanthropology of the past. But all sciences operate by trying to fit new data into existing theories. And this particular science, for which the ?data? has always consisted of scant and somewhat inscrutable bits of rock and fossil, often has to lean on those   even more heavily. ?Assumptions, theories, expectations,? the University of Barcelona archaeologist Jo?o Zilh?o says, ?all must come into play a lot, because you are interpreting data that do not speak for themselves. ? Imagine, for example, working in a cave without any skulls or other easily distinguishable fossils and trying to figure out if you?re looking at a Neanderthal settlement or a more recent, modern human one. In the past, scientists might turn to the surrounding artifacts, interpreting more   tools as evidence of Neanderthals and more   tools as evidence of early modern humans. But working that way, it?s easy to miss evidence of Neanderthals? resemblance to us, because, as soon as you see it, you assume they were us. So many techniques similarly hinge on interpretation and judgment, even perfectly   ones, like ?morphometric analysis?  ?   identifying fossils as belonging to one species rather than another by comparing particular parts of their anatomy  ?   and radiocarbon dating. How the material to be dated is sampled and how results are calibrated are susceptible to drastic revision and bitter disagreement. (What?s more, because of an infuriating quirk of physics, the effectiveness of radiocarbon dating happens to break down around 40, 000 years ago  ?   right around the time of the Neanderthal extinction. One of our best tools for looking into the past becomes unreliable at exactly the moment we?re most interested in examining.) Ultimately, a bottomless relativism can creep in: tenuous interpretations held up by webs of other interpretations, each strung from still more interpretations. Almost every archaeologist I interviewed complained that the field has become ?overinterpreted?  ?   that the ratio of physical evidence to speculation about that evidence is out of whack. Good stories can generate their own momentum. Starting in the 1920s, older and more exciting hominid fossils, like Homo erectus, began surfacing in Africa and Asia, and the field soon shifted its focus there. The Washington University anthropologist Erik Trinkaus, who began his career in the early ?70s, told me, ?When I started working on Neanderthals, nobody really cared about them. ? The liveliest question about Neanderthals was still the first one: Were they our direct ancestors or the endpoint of a separate evolutionary track? Scientists called this question ?the Neanderthal Problem. ? Some of the theories worked up to answer it encouraged different visions of Neanderthal intelligence and behavior. The ?Multiregional Model,? for example, which had us descending from Neanderthals, was more inclined to see them as capable, sympathetic and fundamentally human the opposing ?Out of Africa? hypothesis, which held that we moved in and replaced them, cast them as comparatively inferior. For decades, when evidence of a more advanced Neanderthal way of life turned up, it was often explained away, or mobbed by enough contrary or undermining interpretations that, over time, it never found real purchase. Some findings broke through more than others, however, like the discovery of what was essentially a small Neanderthal cemetery, in Shanidar Cave, in what is now Iraqi Kurdistan. There had been many compelling instances of Neanderthals? burying their dead, but Shanidar was harder to ignore, especially after soil samples revealed the presence of huge amounts of pollen. This was interpreted as the remains of a funerary floral arrangement. An archaeologist at the center of this work, Ralph Solecki, published a book called ?Shanidar: The First Flower People. ? It was 1971  ?   the Age of Aquarius. Those flowers, he?d go on to write, proved that Neanderthals ?had ?soul. ??u2009? Then again, Solecki?s idea was eventually discredited. In 1999, a more thorough analysis of the Shanidar grave site found that Neanderthals almost certainly did not leave flowers there. The pollen had been tracked in, thousands of years later, by burrowing,   rodents. (That said, even a   later, there are still paleoanthropologists at work on this question. It might not have been gerbils it may have been bees.) As more supposed anomalies surfaced, they became harder to brush off. In 1996, the paleoanthropologist   Hublin and others used CT scanning technology to   a bone fragment found in a French cave decades earlier, alongside a raft of advanced tools and artifacts, associated with the   Chtelperronian industry, which archaeologists always presumed was the work of early modern humans. Now Hublin?s analysis identified the bone as belonging to a Neanderthal. But rather than reascribe the Chtelperronian industry to Neanderthals, Hublin chalked up his findings to ?acculturation?: Surely the Neanderthals must have learned how to make this stuff by watching us. ?To me,? says Zilh?o, the University of Barcelona archaeologist, ?there was a logical shock: If the paradigm forces you to say something like this, there must be something wrong with the paradigm. ? Zilh?o published a stinging critique challenging the field to shake off its ?  prejudice. ? Papers were fired back and forth, igniting what Zilh?o calls ?a   war? and counting. Then, in the middle of that war, geneticists shook up the paradigm completely. A group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, led by Svante Paabo, had been assembling a draft sequence of a Neanderthal genome, using DNA recovered from bones. Their findings were published in 2010. It had already become clear by then that Homo sapiens and Neanderthals appeared in Eurasia separately  ?   ?Out of Africa was essentially right?  ?   but Paabo?s work revealed that before the Neanderthals disappeared, the two groups mated. Even today, 40, 000 years after our gene pools stopped mixing, most living humans still carry Neanderthal DNA, making up roughly 1 to 2 percent of our total genomes. The data shows that we also apparently bred with other hominids, like the Denisovans, about which very little is known. It was staggering even Paabo couldn?t bring himself to believe it at first. But the results were the results, and they carried a sort of empirical magnetism that archaeological evidence lacks. ?Geneticists are much more powerful, numerous and incomparably better funded than anyone else dealing with this stuff,? Zilh?o said. He joked: ?Their aura is kind of miraculous. It?s a bit like receiving the Ten Commandments from God. ? Paabo?s work, and a continuing wave of genomic research, has provided clarity but also complexity, recasting our oppositional,   relationship into something more communal and collaborative  ?   and perhaps not just on the genetic level. The extent of the interbreeding supported previous speculation, by a minority of paleoanthropologists, that there might have been cases of Neanderthals and modern humans living alongside each other, intermeshed, for centuries, and that generations of their offspring had found places in those communities, too. Then again, it?s also possible that some of the interbreeding was forced. Paabo now recommends against imagining separate species of human evolution altogether: not an Us and a Them, but one enormous ?metapopulation? composed of shifting clusters of essentially   things that periodically coincided in time and space and, when they happened to bump into one another, occasionally had sex. Lunch happened at the mouth of Gorham?s Cave, out in the sun. I ate a sandwich on a log, facing the sea, alongside Jennings and a few of his Liverpool students, while the young men and women from Spain mingled behind us, laughing and stretching and helping one another crack their backs. The language barrier seemed to discourage the two cohorts from talking much. And yet the students lived together during the excavation and had somehow achieved a muffled camaraderie. Even Jennings and his counterpart, Jos? Mara Guti?rrez Lpez, a veteran archaeologist from a museum in Cdiz, had a somewhat similar dynamic, despite working closely together for many summers at Gorham?s. Neither was terribly fluent in the other?s language, but their silence, by this point, seemed warm and knowing. Waiting for our ride at the end of one workday, I noticed them staring at a plastic bag snagged in the concertina wire above an old military gate. The bag had been there for a long, long time, Jennings told me. Then he turned and uttered, ?Cinco a?os?? Guti?rrez Lpez smiled. ?S,? he said, nodding. I, meanwhile, felt compelled to test out all of this as a model for   relations. That contact obsessed me: What would it have been like to look out over a grassy plain and watch parallel humanity pass by? Scientists often turn to historical first contacts as frames of reference, like the arrival of Europeans among Native Americans, or Captain Cook landing in Australia  ?   largely histories of violence and subjugation. But as Zilh?o points out, typically one of those two cultures set out to conquer the other. ?Those people were conscious that they?d come from somewhere else,? he told me. ?They were a product of a civilization that had books, that had studied their past. ? Homo sapiens encountering Neanderthals would have been different: They met uncoupled from politics and history neither identified as part of a network of millions of supposedly more advanced people. And so, as Finlayson put it to me: ?Each valley could have told a different story. In one, they may have hit each other over the head. In another, they may have made love. In another, they ignored each other. ? It?s a kind of coexistence that our modern imaginations may no longer be sensitive enough to envision. So much of our identity as a species is tied up in our anomalousness, in our dominion over others. But that narcissistic   is an exceedingly recent privilege. (?Outside the world of Tolkienesque fantasy literature, we tend to think that it is normal for there to be just one human species on Earth at a time,? the writers Dimitra Papagianni and Michael A. Morse explain. ?The past 20 or 30 millennia, however, have been the exception. ?) Now, eating lunch, I considered that the   of humans and Neanderthals hadn?t been so trippy or profound after all. Maybe it looked as mundane as this: two groups, lingering on a beach, only sort of acknowledging each other. Maybe the many millenniums during which we shared Eurasia was, much of the time, like a superlong elevator ride with strangers. Some paleoanthropologists are starting to reimagine the extinction of Neanderthals as equally prosaic: not the culmination of some epic clash of civilizations but an aggregate result of a long, ecological muddle. Strictly speaking, extinction is ;;;;
17594;Trip Gabriel;19/01/2017;2017;1;business;MONTICELLO, Iowa  ?   The Table of Knowledge was delving into   Donald J. Trump?s plans to upend government, and marveling at how he had forced his fellow Republicans in the House to reverse themselves on gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics. ?He?s getting responses things are happening,? Jerry Retzlaff, a retiree, said. ?He got Congress to turn themselves around with one tweet. ? ?There?s no secret the press doesn?t like him, and neither does a lot of the leadership,? he added. ?And that?s because he?s planning on making a lot of changes. ? The eight men around a rectangular table, sipping coffee from a hodgepodge of mugs donated by customers, meet daily for breakfasts of French toast, eggs and bacon at Darrell?s diner, all while solving the world?s problems, hence their gathering?s nickname. Washington may be veering from one Trump   controversy to another: unproved reports of Russia?s holding embarrassing information against him, possible ethical conflicts, the donors and billionaires of his cabinet, his pushback against intelligence findings on Russian hacking in the election. But there does not seem to be much angst in Iowa among those who voted for Mr. Trump, including some Democrats and independents. Monticello, in rural eastern Iowa, is as close as any place to the epicenter of the political quake that made Mr. Trump president. The state?s longstanding reputation as a political bellwether had led The New York Times to move me to Iowa for a full year ahead of its presidential caucuses in early 2016. I had not returned since. In the intervening year, Iowa gave  Mr. Trump his largest triumph of any battleground state: a    reversal over President Obama?s easy victory here in 2012. Al Ameling, 58, a technical analyst who lives in Marble Rock, near the Minnesota border, is representative of the profound demographic shift among white rural voters in the northern Midwest that helped produce Mr. Trump?s stunning upset. Mr. Ameling voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, sat out in 2012 and enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump. Nothing he has heard since Election Day has shaken his support, including reports this week that American intelligence agencies are investigating unverified accounts of meetings between Trump aides and Russian officials, as well as sex tapes purportedly made of Mr. Trump in Moscow. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the allegations completely false. ?The way it is nowadays, unless I see positive proof, it?s all a lie,? Mr. Ameling said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. He added he was more concerned that government officials might have leaked the material to the news media. ?I don?t know if it was classified, but if it was, whoever leaked it needs to go to jail,? he said. ?We need law and order back in this country. ? I headed to Monticello because it was the site of Hillary Clinton?s first campaign stop after declaring her candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2015. When she rolled up in her black van, a pack of journalists took off at a run, myself included, an enduringly silly image. Mrs. Clinton rarely returned to the state in the general election campaign, giving it up as all but lost. Jones County, which includes Monticello, is the birthplace of the painter Grant Wood, and where older men still wear the style of pinstriped overalls in his ?American Gothic. ? It is a beautiful place, with bald eagles soaring over wintry farm fields. Mr. Trump carried the county by 20 percentage points Mr. Obama easily won there four years earlier. At Darrell?s, there are actually two Tables of Knowledge, one favored by Democrats and the other by Republicans. Among them are an optometrist, farmers and former employees of a utility company. I asked if there was anyone who had voted for Mr. Trump after having previously supported Mr. Obama. ?Yeah, there is, but they won?t tell you,? said Mr. Retzlaff, an outspoken conservative who usually chooses to sit with the liberals. Mel Manternach, a retired farmer, said many farmers who had once voted for Mr. Obama switched to Mr. Trump, which he found perplexing. ?Trump was against T. P. P. which would help exports of ag commodities,? he said, referring to the   Partnership, a   deal. ?They voted against their own  . ? The Iowans I interviewed largely went about their lives outside the political hothouse of social media. They did not follow    developments of the presidential transition. Indeed, on Wednesday, several were unfamiliar with the reports that Russia was holding compromising information on the   which Mr. Trump addressed in a news conference. Many were hazy on specific policy details about how, say, House Republicans were seeking to replace Medicare with a voucher system. These voters feared an outbreak of   terrorist attacks by Muslims in the United States, maybe in their own communities. And overwhelmingly, Trump supporters did not want their   money redistributed to people they regarded as undeserving. A year ago, I shadowed a Clinton   in Newton, a small city in central Iowa that has struggled since Maytag closed a washing machine plant. Jeff McKibben, one of the   workers, traded down for work at a prison. Once a ?straight Democrat,? as he called himself, he refused to commit at the time to support Mrs. Clinton. Contacted recently, he did not want to say how he voted, although Jasper County, which includes Newton, was one of the more than 30 Iowa counties that swung to Mr. Trump from Mr. Obama. ?Maybe it?s time to have some change,? Mr. McKibben allowed. ?I saw neighbors I knew were strong union people with Trump signs in their yards. ? The story was the same in Des Moines County, in southeastern Iowa. The local Democratic Party chairwoman, Sandy Dockendorff, knew there was trouble when she saw a Trump sign in the yard of an electrician who had always supported Democrats. ?When I called him,? Ms. Dockendorff explained last month to a group of demoralized activists at a United Steelworkers union hall, ?he said, ?You stopped talking my language you don?t care about jobs.? ? In an interview, Ms. Dockendorff, who is running for chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said rural Iowans were critical of Democrats for opposing   projects like oil pipelines while running a presidential campaign focused narrowly on Mr. Trump?s shortcomings. ?It was all about making fun of Donald Trump  ?   he would never be president and how horrible it would be,? she said. But ?the only one talking about jobs was Trump,? Ms. Dockendorff added. At a Des Moines County diner in Burlington, a small city on the Mississippi River, Melissa Ell, a waitress, said she had voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. But this Election Day, she stayed home. ?I didn?t want to vote for either one of them, to be honest,? she said. Ms. Ell, 46, earns a base wage of $6. 50 an hour at Jerry?s Main Lunch, a   restaurant across from the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks. As she bused a table, Ms. Ell commiserated with Jackie Furman about those who take advantage of government aid. ?I think they should be   if they?re on welfare,? Ms. Ell said. ?The welfare system needs to be reorganized,? agreed Ms. Furman, a retired commercial bakery manager, complaining that ?Chicago people? were moving to Burlington to receive higher benefits and bringing crime. Ms. Furman, 70, said, ?I?m ashamed to say we caucused for Obama? in 2008. ?My view is he purposely got into the presidency so he could ruin America. ? There are contrary views. On Washington Street in Burlington, I expected Post 10102 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to be a bastion of support for the   who had promised repeatedly to ?take care of the vets. ? But there was deep skepticism. ?Forget about me,? Dan Meade, a Navy veteran, said. ?What?s going to happen to our kids, our grandkids? I think the guy?s nuts. ? He and three others sipped $1. 50 draft beers from plastic cups. They sarcastically echoed notable Trump lines from the campaign trail. ?He knows more than the generals he doesn?t like prisoners of war,? Dan Warren, an Army veteran, said. ?When Trump was running for office he said he?d run the country like he runs his companies,? Fran Boyle, who served in the Navy, chimed in. ?Which one of his bankrupt companies is he going to run it like?? Still, Trump voters in the state say they are hoping for the best. Mike Staudt, a retired farmer from Marble Rock, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012, but called the Affordable Care Act a form of socialism. He said he had no problem with a candidate who had run as the voice of the working people but was stocking his cabinet with the ultrawealthy. ?I know these guys are really rich,? he said. ?They may have pulled off a few plays that weren?t exactly on the    but they all had to be pretty smart to be billionaires. If they replace their own concerns with the concerns of the country, they can make things really move forward. That?s what I?m excited about. ?;;;;
17601;Thomas Kaplan and Robert Pear;19/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster. The vote was 51 to 48. During the roll call, Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage. One by one, Democrats rose to voice their objections. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were ?stealing health care from Americans. ? Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no ?because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy. ? The presiding officer, Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, repeatedly banged his gavel and said the Democrats were out of order because ?debate is not allowed during a vote. ? The final vote, which ended just before 1:30 a. m. followed a marathon session in which senators took    roll call votes on numerous amendments, an arduous exercise known as a   . The approval of the budget blueprint, coming even before   Donald J. Trump is inaugurated, shows the speed with which Republican leaders are moving to fulfill their promise to repeal President Obama?s signature domestic policy achievement  ?   a goal they believe can now be accomplished after Mr. Trump?s election. The action by the Senate is essentially procedural, setting the stage for a special kind of legislation called a reconciliation bill. Such a bill can be used to repeal significant parts of the health law and, critically, is immune from being filibustered. Congress appears to be at least weeks away from voting on legislation repealing the law. Republicans say the 2016 elections gave them a mandate to roll back the health care law. ?The Obamacare bridge is collapsing, and we?re sending in a rescue team,? said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ?Then we?ll build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new bridges are finished, we?ll close the old bridge. ? Republican leaders say they will work closely with Mr. Trump developing legislation to repeal and replace the health care law, but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law ?essentially simultaneously. ? He said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, is confirmed. The Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in the American health care system, and unwinding it will be a formidable challenge for Republicans. More than 20 million people have gained coverage under the law, though premiums have risen sharply in many states and some insurers have fled the law?s health exchanges. The budget blueprint instructs House and Senate committees to come up with repeal legislation by Jan. 27. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and four other Republicans had sought to extend that deadline by five weeks, to March 3. But late Wednesday night, Mr. Corker withdrew an amendment that would have changed the date. ?We understand that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right,? he said. He described the Jan. 27 date in the budget blueprint as a placeholder. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, another Republican who sought to delay the deadline, said: ?This date is not a date that is set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it. But it could take longer, and we believe that it might. ? The House was planning to take up the budget blueprint once the Senate approved it, though some House Republicans have expressed discomfort with voting on the blueprint this week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced. A vote on the measure in the House could come on Friday. In its lengthy series of votes, the Senate rejected amendments proposed by Democrats that were intended to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada, protect rural hospitals and ensure continued access to coverage for people with   conditions, among other causes. In the parlance of Capitol Hill, many of the Democrats? proposals were ?messaging amendments,? intended to put Republicans on record as opposing popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The budget blueprint is for the guidance of Congress it is not presented to the president for a signature or veto and does not become law. As the Senate plowed through its work on Wednesday, Republicans explained why they were determined to dismantle the health care law, and they tried to assuage concerns about the future of coverage for millions of Americans. ?This is our opportunity to keep our campaign promise,? said Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. ?This is our opportunity to help the   and the vice   keep their campaign promises and show to the American people that elections have consequences. ? Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said that while working to repeal the health care law, ?we must also talk about what we replace it with, because repealing it without a replacement is an unacceptable solution. ? Republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Wednesday that she agreed with Mr. Trump that Congress should repeal the health law and adopt a replacement plan at about the same time. ?But I don?t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month,? she said. ?I just don?t see that as being feasible. ? (Ms. Collins also supported pushing back the deadline to come up with repeal legislation.) As Republicans pursue repealing the law, Democrats contend that Republicans are trying to rip insurance away from millions of Americans with no idea of what to do next. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, called the Republicans? repeal plan ?irresponsible and rushed? and urged them to halt their push to unravel the law. ?Don?t put chaos in place of affordable care,? he said.;;;;
17606;Choe Sang-Hun;13/01/2017;2017;1;lifestyle;SEOUL, South Korea  ?   When the South Korean artist Hong   produced a painting that depicted President Park   as a scarecrow manipulated by evil forces, including her dictator father, her senior aides discussed how to ?punish? Mr. Hong, according to a diary one of them kept. Soon after the painting?s completion in August 2014, the retaliation began as planned in the aide?s diary, which surfaced in November in the investigation into the corruption scandal that has led to Ms. Park?s impeachment trial. First, a   civic group sued Mr. Hong on charges of defaming Ms. Park. Then his work was excluded from the Gwangju Biennale, South Korea?s   international arts festival, an act Gwangju?s mayor later admitted was due to government pressure. The retaliation did not stop there, Mr. Hong said. ?Dozens of conservative activists showed up in front of my apartment like a goon squad, shaking my photographs and calling me a ?Communist painter,?? he said. ?I received death threats on the phone. ? As it turned out, Mr. Hong was one of thousands of artists reportedly blacklisted by the government of Ms. Park, whose powers have been suspended as she faces an impeachment trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power. The blacklist is just one element in the sprawling case that has infuriated the public and prompted national introspection about South Korea?s young democracy and its authoritarian past. On Thursday, three of Ms. Park?s former aides, including one of her former culture ministers, Kim   were arrested on charges of blacklisting cultural figures deemed unfriendly and barring them from   support programs. So far, two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media, citing anonymous sources. Officials, including the special prosecutor in the case, Park   have confirmed the existence of the blacklist but have not released it. A 2015 version of the list included more than 9, 000 people, according to news reports. The list contained some of South Korea?s most beloved filmmakers, actors and writers, including the director of ?Oldboy,? Park   and the ?Snowpiercer? actor Song  . Officially, Ms. Park has made promoting movies and other cultural products one of her key priorities. But secretly, her government has blackballed artists, reviving a practice of past military dictators like her father, Park   and in so doing has ?seriously undermined the freedom of thought and expression,? the special prosecutor?s office said. The revelations about the cultural blacklist added a new layer of notoriety to the scandal surrounding Ms. Park, and prosecutors planned to use the list to help strengthen the impeachment charges against her. When the National Assembly voted to impeach Ms. Park last month, it accused her of conspiring with her longtime confidante, Choi   to solicit bribes from businesses and crack down on uncooperative officials and journalists. The special prosecutor is investigating whether Ms. Park and Kim    ?   her former chief of staff, who was depicted as one of the dark forces in Mr. Hong?s painting  ?   were involved in the blacklisting of artists. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Kim, her former chief of staff, have denied involvement. However, another of Ms. Park?s former culture ministers, Yoo   said the list was dictated by the president?s office. On Monday, the current culture minister, Cho   said, ?I understand how pained artists must have felt when excluded from government support just because of their political and ideological beliefs. ? For many South Koreans, news of the blacklisting of artists reawakened memories from the nation?s dictatorial past. Ms. Park?s father, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, censored newspapers and imprisoned dissident writers and publishers. Chun   a military dictator during the 1980s, banished a comedian from TV after people compared the appearances of the two men. (Both were bald.) Subsequent governments were accused of favoring   scholars and civic groups when doling out research projects and subsidies. Under Ms. Park?s conservative predecessor, Lee   some celebrities and journalists deemed progressive were barred from   broadcasters. But the latest revelations marked the first time the existence of an extensive government blacklist was revealed since South Korea moved toward democracy in the late 1980s. ?It?s an honor to be on the list,? Ko Un, one of South Korea?s   poets, told the broadcaster SBS last month, when it reported on another version of the list. ?This shows how disgusting the government is. ? Under Ms. Park, whose leadership style is often compared to her father?s, rumors of a blacklist have been circulating for years. The rumors intensified after two   theatrical directors were mysteriously booted from government subsidy programs: one had campaigned for Ms. Park?s main opponent in the 2012 election another had produced a play spoofing Ms. Park and her father. And after the organizers of the Busan International Film Festival screened a documentary that delved into what it called Ms. Park?s botched response to the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014 in which more than 300 people died, the festival lost half of its government funding. Mr. Yoo, the former culture minister, said Mr. Kim, Ms. Park?s chief of staff at the time, began ordering the culture ministry to blacklist certain artists in 2013. Last month, a former aide to Ms. Park was indicted on charges of colluding with her in an attempt to blackmail a vice chairwoman of CJ, which runs South Korea?s biggest film studio, into retiring in 2013. The company had angered Ms. Park?s office by financing a movie about her ideological enemy, the former President Roh   Mr. Yoo said in a radio interview last month. ?I thought this kind of thing happened only under the past military rule,? CJ?s chairman, Sohn   told a parliamentary hearing last month. Mr. Yoo said that an early version of the blacklist he saw in June 2014 included hundreds of artists. Shortly before he was replaced a month later, Mr. Yoo said he met Ms. Park to warn against the list. (Ms. Park has denied being warned.) By 2015, the list had ballooned to include more than 9, 000 visual artists, musicians, actors, film and musical directors, and writers deemed critical of Ms. Park, particularly those who took aim at her handling of the ferry disaster or who were suspected of supporting her rivals, according to the Hankook Ilbo newspaper, which published what it claimed was the list in October. Ms. Park?s office zealously pursued her opponents after the ferry disaster, according to the diary of Kim   the former presidential aide who detailed the retaliation against Mr. Hong. The ferry tragedy is a central motif in Mr. Hong?s painting. During a meeting of senior presidential aides in 2014, Mr. Kim, Ms. Park?s chief of staff at the time, called for a ?combative response to leftists in the cultural and art circles? and ordered the aides to ?discover their networks,? according to the diary. He compared progressive teachers and journalists ?to poisonous mushrooms. ? The diary also recorded instructions to punish artists who satirized Ms. Park, conduct a ?loyalty check? of senior government officials, ?intimidate? courts of law and ?induce? scholars to write   newspaper columns. ?Make them afraid to challenge the president,? Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a diary entry dated July 4, 2014. He has denied giving such an order and said that the diary did not faithfully record what was actually discussed during the aides? meetings. The author of the diary, Kim   died in August, but prosecutors said they found it useful in building their case against Ms. Park. Mr. Hong, the painter, said that for poor artists, being cut off from travel and other government support programs could be crushing. In 2015, Mr. Hong was invited to show his painting at a Berlin arts festival. But no domestic logistics company would transport the work for fear of government retaliation. Mr. Hong had to travel alone and hurriedly repaint a copy of the original in Berlin. He also suspected the government was behind a tax audit of his wife?s clinic last year. ?It makes me shudder that Park   and her cronies tried to tame artists by holding back a pittance of government support while they themselves pocket millions,? Mr. Hong said. ?They showed how depraved political power can be. ?;;;;
17612;Jennifer Senior;12/01/2017;2017;1;politics;Let?s just get this out of the way, shall we? Ayelet Waldman: intemperate tweeter, guerrilla oversharer, provocateur, literary exhibitionist, cyclone of sass. When The New York Times Book Review didn?t select her novel ?Love and Treasure? as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2014, she unleashed a  tweetstorm of hurt. (  excerpt: ?there are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine. ?) When she announced in a 2005 essay that she loved her husband, the novelist Michael Chabon, more than she loved her children, outraged mothers everywhere clucked and   and when she expressed surprise, the chorus came back  ?   Well, what on earth did you expect? But here?s my question for those who sneer at or   her new memoir about the possible therapeutic value of LSD, ?A Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference in My Mood, My Marriage, and My Life?: What on earth did you expect? Here is the truth about Ms. Waldman, which complicates matters for those who don?t like her: She has spent many years struggling with punishing, ungovernable moods. Originally, doctors told her she had bipolar II disorder years later, a psychiatrist decided premenstrual dysphoric disorder more closely corresponded with her symptoms, and Ms. Waldman agreed. But whatever it?s called, hers is not a mood disorder of the quiet, novelistic variety. It?s big and operatic, often driving her to do the very things for which she?s been publicly shamed: acting out, picking fights, trawling for affirmation. Just because she doesn?t have a picturesque version of melancholy doesn?t make it any less real or any less deserving of compassion. And after reading ?A Really Good Day,? you understand just why Ms. Waldman might have been willing to experiment to find relief. She?d exhausted her family. She?d exhausted all manner of therapies. And she?d exhausted just about every drug in the pharmacopoeia  ?   including the ones that sound like Spanish dances (Cymbalta, Strattera, Concerta) the ones that look like typing tests (Zoloft, Effexor, Seroquel) and the ones that could well be craters on the moon (Valium, Ambien, Lunesta). Her Ambien dependence proved particularly problematic. When she took too much, she?d have text exchanges with Mr. Chabon that looked like this: Hence Ms. Waldman?s   trial with LSD  ?   10 micrograms every three days. A microdose, as she explains, is anywhere from   to   of what one would find on a   tab of acid. It doesn?t turn the world into a bubbling lava lamp. This dosage, taken at this rate, is ?? according to the psychologist and former psychedelic researcher James Fadiman. Mr. Fadiman?s (admittedly informal, nonrandomized) research suggests that people who follow this protocol simply feel   ?     better. Ms. Waldman wanted to know what something as luxuriously pedestrian as ?better? was like. ?A Really Good Day? is a captain?s log of her    trip. It combines daily reports of her moods with the research she?s done about the history of psychedelics and her extended meditations on drugs and the law. (Before becoming a writer, Ms. Waldman was a federal public defender.) And what does she find? That the experience really is transformative. ?You?ve been much happier,? her younger daughter tells her. ?You?ve been controlling your emotions. Like, when you?re angry, you?re  . ? The reader doesn?t have quite as uniformly positive an experience. Part of the problem is aesthetic: Ms. Waldman has a tendency to slide into the prefab language of psychotherapy or  . (?It is suddenly so obvious that what I need to do is just get out of my own way. ?) Her sense of humor can be unsubtle. (On the weak magic mushrooms she once tried in college: ?It?s possible that all I ate was a handful of dried shiitakes dipped in cow manure. ?) She?s a fan of extended metaphors, and almost no one should be a fan of extended metaphors. They involve beating a dead horse, converting it to glue, and then discovering the glue doesn?t work. If you see what I mean. And her observations can be trite. Her anxious   while meditating  ?   ?Now you?re thinking about thinking! Stop berating yourself for thinking!?  ?   will surprise exactly no one. But then Ms. Waldman will capture you with genuinely brave and human moments, like when she confesses that she yells at people because she enjoys it. Or when she says her talents aren?t considerable enough to earn her a great artist?s tempestuous mood swings. Or expresses guilt that her oldest child has had to bear the brunt of her anger and depression. Her reminiscences about her time defending poor, defenseless clients in Los Angeles are riveting. I am not sure they belong in this book  ?   especially when she talks about the unfairness of our sentencing guidelines (I mean, agreed, but this is neither the time nor the place for  )  ?   but I?d love to see an independent memoir about her legal work one day. Ms. Waldman?s survey of the history and literature of psychotropic drugs is informative, though it can also, on occasion, be too sloppy and loose. She casually drops the phrase ?Alzheimer?  benzos? (short for benzodiazepines, that class of   drugs including Valium and Xanax) without so much as a footnote, and this claim is hardly settled science. She writes that Francis Crick ?reportedly? experimented with LSD when he envisioned the double helix, and then takes it back in a footnote. ?Couldn?t we just pretend it?s true?? she asks. No, we can?t. There are other uncareful moments of this kind, and other undocumented declarations. I mention them not to be picayune, but because writing about drug research is a delicate business, requiring a certain amount of control in one?s voice. You really don?t want readers doubting your authority when you?re making an argument in favor of a maligned and illegal substance. But it?s an argument that needs to be made. As she did with her 2009 essay collection, ?Bad Mother,? which decriminalized ordinary mommy infractions and helped bring a sense of proportion to the messy enterprise of parenting, Ms. Waldman brings a huge dose of compassion and, yes, good sense to ?A Really Good Day. ? Whatever her foibles or stylistic lapses, she makes a persuasive case for the therapeutic use of psychedelics. (Want to be inspired? Read the research on the effects of hallucinogens on dying cancer patients.) As ever, Ms. Waldman is wielding her powers of provocation to goad us into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation. Quibble with her style, her methods, her desire to attract attention. In normalizing the conversation about LSD, she may one day help others feel normal.;;;;
17627;Mike Ives;16/01/2017;2017;1;business;HONG KONG  ?   At the Addiction Treatment Center in eastern China, more than 6, 000 internet addicts  ?   most of them teenagers  ?   not only had their web access taken away, they were also treated with electroshock therapy. The center, in Shandong Province, made headlines in September after one of its patients killed her mother in retribution for abuse she had purportedly suffered at the camp during a forced detox regimen. Now China is trying to regulate camps like the one in Shandong, which have become a last resort for parents exasperated by their child?s habit of playing online games for hours on end. The government has drafted a law that would crack down on the camps? worst excesses, including electroshock and other ?physical punishments. ? Medical specialists welcomed the law, announced this week in China?s   news media, as an initial step toward curbing scandals in the industry. ?It?s a very important move for protecting young children,? said Tao Ran, the director of the Internet Addiction Clinic at Beijing Military General Hospital. Dr. Tao said that many Chinese parents believe that the effects of electroshock therapy are fleeting. But he had seen several Chinese teenagers return from boot camps that treat internet addiction showing signs of lasting psychological trauma, he said. ?They didn?t talk, were afraid to meet people and refused to leave their homes,? he said, referring to his meetings with the teenagers. ?They were panicked even to hear the word ?hospital? and ?doctor. ?? Qu Xinjiu, a law professor at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said the belief that parents have supreme jurisdiction over their children, and that even police officers have no right to intervene in family affairs, is widespread in China. ?That?s why there are so many parents sending their kids for electroshock therapy, even when outsiders think it?s wrong to do so,? Professor Qu said. Figures on the number or growth of internet detox camps in China are scarce, but the camps? methods have been generating concern for years. The legislation would also limit how much time each day that minors could play online games at home or in internet bars. Providers of the games would be obliged to take measures to monitor and restrict use, such as requiring players to register under their real names. The law does not yet specify the number of hours allowed, but minors would be prohibited from playing online games anywhere between midnight and 8 a. m. Dr. Tao said he doubted that the draft law, which was introduced by the State Council, China?s cabinet, could be enforced evenly nationwide. Provisions to limit the number of hours spent online probably could be easily flouted, he said. Many users of Sina Weibo, China?s version of Twitter, were even more critical, saying policing teenagers? behavior online seemed impractical and  . ?I?m afraid it?s just empty talk,? a Sina Weibo user wrote. ?What about young kids who always go online on their cellphones?? another wrote. ?Isn?t that also an addiction?? Game providers and internet bars that did not enforce the law would be subject to fines and possible closure by the government. Reports in the Chinese news media this week said that lawmakers would accept public comments on the draft law through early February but gave no indication of when it might be put into practice. In 2009, the Chinese Health Ministry issued guidelines against using electroshock therapy for internet addicts. Trent M. Bax, the author of ?Youth and Internet Addiction in China,? said that he wondered whether a ban would be any more effective. Despite the Health Ministry?s policy, ?punitive practices continue to victimize China?s youth? in internet detox camps, said Dr. Bax, an assistant professor of sociology at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. Researchers from Chinese, Taiwanese and German universities wrote in the journal   Psychiatry in 2014 that the highest prevalence of ?problematic internet use? worldwide had been observed in Asia. Christian Montag, the study?s lead author, said in an email on Thursday that South Korea had the world?s highest rate of problematic internet use, in part because of its large technology sector and online game market. South Korea also offers camps for internet addiction. Recent scientific evidence indicates that the best treatments for digital addiction appear to be cognitive behavioral therapy in individual and group settings, which often include patients? parents and significant others, said Daria J. Kuss, a specialist on internet and game addiction at Nottingham Trent University in Britain. Dr. Kuss said that medication can also be effective, especially if internet addiction is accompanied by anxiety or mood disorders, such as depression. But beatings and electroshock therapy ?are not commonly used in the treatment of internet and gaming addiction and are to be considered unethical and inhumane,? she said. Officials and psychologists around the world have debated how to measure and regulate extreme internet use. A crucial question, analysts say, is whether to classify the problem as a psychological disorder or as a symptom of underlying disorders. In a sign of how fluid the debate is in China, the Health Ministry said in 2009 that it would no longer use the term ?addiction? to describe how the internet harmed people who used it improperly or excessively. But a study the same year by the China Youth Association for Network Development, which is led by a committee under the ruling Communist Party, found that more than 24 million Chinese, age 13 to 29, who used the internet were digital addicts.;;;;
17634;Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim;14/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;HAMBURG  ?   Of course there was Beethoven. After all, what better way to conclude the   opening concert of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall here than with the jubilant ?Ode to Joy?? It?s a choral classic, but Wednesday?s scintillating concert, starring the NDR Symphony Orchestra, now renamed the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, opened with the slender, pliable tone of a single oboe  ?   the instrument to which other players tune in halls around the world. To inaugurate this dazzling hall, nestled inside an $800 million glass structure set atop an old brick warehouse overlooking the port here, the conductor Thomas Hengelbrock assembled a   program. Taking as its motto a line from Wagner?s ?Parsifal?  ?   ?Here time becomes space?  ?   the concert linked fragile chamber performances and flashy orchestral tours de force spanning 400 years of music history into a riveting narrative. Its proud protagonist: the hall itself. Depending on where you sat in the tiered,    auditorium, you had to crane your neck to see where the first sounds were coming from when the oboist Kalev Kuljus, standing on a high balcony, intoned the first rhapsodic phrases of Britten?s ?Pan,? from ?Six Metamorphoses After Ovid. ? His penetrating and clear tone helped to concentrate your ear on the sonic roller coaster that followed, beginning with the metallic aureole of Dutilleux?s ?Myst?re de l?instant. ? From there, early and recent music alternated fluidly, with individual performers placed high in the farthest rows. The countertenor Philippe Jaroussky, elegantly accompanied by the harpist Margret K?ll, sang music written by Emilio de? Cavalieri and Antonio Archilei for a 1589 Florentine court wedding, his zesty voice effortlessly carrying across the   auditorium. The dark, growling rumbles of Bernd Alois Zimmermann?s ?Photoptosis,? in turn, gave way to the   Ensemble Praetorius singing Praetorius?s ?Quam Pulchra Es. ? That work was answered by the searing intensity of Rolf Liebermann?s ?Furioso,? with its   string scales and luscious, broad melodies. Another Baroque aria, ?Amarilli mia bella,? by Giulio Caccini, offered quiet reflection before the jaunty finale from Messiaen?s ?? its crisp rhythms and fluorescent tone colors vivid and clean. The concert?s second half included the Prelude to ?Parsifal? the premiere of an arresting, broody orchestral song cycle, ?Reminiszenz,? by Wolfgang Rihm and the last movement of Beethoven?s Ninth. The soloist in Rihm?s rangy, difficult new work was Pavol Breslik, whose melting tone easily made you forget that the part had initially been intended for the star tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Another cancellation led to the appealing   Mller?s taking on the soprano part in the Beethoven symphony, alongside the alto Wiebke Lehmkuhl and the   Bryn Terfel, sounding somewhat brittle. The combined NDR and Bavarian radio choirs brought home a thrilling ?Ode to Joy. ? If you were seated in different sections of the hall for the two performances (the program was repeated on Thursday night) the sound?s warmth varied. The Wagner could have been helped by a greater sense of mysticism: the acoustics cast a clinical light on occasional imperfections. (It was just as unforgiving of a visitor?s   sneeze.) But on the whole, the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra revealed itself as a   group, possessing a radiantly confident brass section and strings capable of producing a   tone. The man behind the sound is Yasuhisa Toyota, one of the world?s most   acousticians. In Hamburg, his work was prepared for by the building?s architects, the Swiss firm Herzog  de Meuron, which added a   layer around each of the two concert halls to prevent the intrusion of foghorns and other city noise  ?   something New Yorkers, used to the periodic grumble of subway trains below several performance spaces, might appreciate. The Elbphilharmonie?s larger hall is clad with thousands of grooved   panels, the profile of each precisely calculated to optimize resonance. Visually, the effect is stunning, reminiscent of bleached coral or snakeskin, depending on the lighting. On one side of the hall, softly gleaming organ pipes appear like a waterfall. The elegance of this Great Hall finds no reflection in the Small Hall, which opened on Thursday afternoon with a program of chamber music presented by Ensemble Resonanz. Here, too, Mr. Toyota created a minutely modulated acoustic ?skin,? this one carved into sensual waves in oak. The   sound was warm and opulent in works by Georg Friedrich Haas (a premiere, ?Release,? making lavish use of the microtonal shimmies for which this   composer, based in New York, is known) Berg and Bartok. Visually, the rectangular box resembles an oversize sauna. After years of delays and budget increases, which sometimes made it a laughingstock, the Elbphilharmonie is finally open, with music at its center. Judging by the creative zest of the opening events, it is on track to incubate a musical culture as optimistic and striking as the building itself.;;;;
17638;Greg Howard;15/01/2017;2017;1;business;?The best people. ? This refrain rang throughout Donald Trump?s presidential campaign at times, it seemed to be his justification for being in the race at all. He wasn?t a politician  ?   he was a businessman. He had never run a government, but he ran a company, and running a company is, at bottom, easy: You get the best people. The pitch worked, and Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. In the meantime, he has been stocking his cabinet with what he promises are the best people. Even without thinking too hard about what ?best? means  ?   best for whom? to do what?  ?   it?s still instructive to see who made the cut. The two people who will be perched on Trump?s shoulders, his chief of staff Reince Priebus and his chief strategist Steve Bannon, are white men. The top layer of his cabinet  ?   the attorney general, as well as the secretaries of state, Treasury and defense  ?   is made up of white men. In fact, if you print out a chart with the faces of Trump?s picks on it, the first thing you?re likely to notice about it is that his cabinet consists almost entirely of white men. And the second thing you?re likely to notice is Dr. Ben Carson. His is a conspicuous face. It?s black, for one, which makes it, in this cabinet, unique. It?s also famous: Carson is one of the   medical doctors of our time and mounted a presidential run of his own. But Carson?s face seems to be in the wrong place. The retired neurosurgeon won?t be running, say, Health and Human Services he?ll manage the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His inclusion is conspicuous for another reason too: Shortly after the election, Carson?s friend and adviser Armstrong Williams said that Carson wouldn?t take a cabinet position, because he had no governing experience. ?The last thing he would want to do,? Williams said, ?was take a position that could cripple the presidency. ? It seems very unlikely that a retired neurosurgeon with no governing experience is one of ?the best people? to handle city planning and housing policies. So why is he there? Carson certainly looks like what people might call a token: Someone admitted into a space dominated by one group mostly to feign inclusivity toward others. It feels unkind to actually call him that: It?s rude, messy and dismissive of Carson?s agency and ability. Still, this administration stands to be mighty white and male, and its few women and people of color, tend to appear in roles that feel like afterthoughts or stereotypes. It?s almost funny in its clumsiness. Nikki Haley, who has virtually no   experience but is the child of Indian immigrants, will be ambassador to the United Nations. A black man will oversee housing projects. As of late December, Politico was reporting that Trump?s staff was ?scrambling? to find a Hispanic candidate to head the Department of Agriculture. These appointees may be as accomplished and well qualified as anyone else in Trump?s cabinet. But the stagecraft and typecasting of their appointments are definitely what you might call tokenism, writ large and on full, public display. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which expanded on President Franklin D. Roosevelt?s order, signed 20 years earlier, which banned racial discrimination in the federal government and defense industries. Kennedy ordered that government contractors ?take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color or national origin. ? Three years later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extended that action to women. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 banned housing discrimination. By the decade?s end there was, at least in theory, a commitment to include everyone in American life  ?   an admission that per federal law, if only per federal law, women and brown people were full citizens. One response was violence. Where violence was ineffective or unacceptable, other forms of resistance had to suffice. Schools integrated spasmodically, often kicking and screaming in court. Workplaces often didn?t. Many white homeowners and landlords refused to sell or rent to families of color. In 1973 in New York, President Richard Nixon?s Department of Justice sued Donald Trump and his father for refusing to rent to black people. That the Trumps objected and denied this reflected not just their legal situation but a growing social consensus that things like naked racism and sexism were untoward  ?   things few people wanted to be accused of or forced to defend. But institutions throughout the nation also found it difficult to stop doing them. This is the world that brought us modern American tokenism, both as a word and as a practice. People concluded that it was easier to fake inclusion than truly include women and people of color. The easiest course was to find one person who could serve as a   to appear in a classroom or a workplace to signal that everyone was getting a fair shot  ?   not only when that was untrue, but because it was untrue and needed hiding. Tokenism is, above all, a form of misdirection. It?s the smiling Muslim kid on the school brochure, the black editorial assistant in the   newsroom, the telegenic woman serving as a campaign spokeswoman. By the   television and film had mastered this, too, dutifully checking off boxes with actors of color whose purpose was mainly to be seen. These were minor, disposable mascots who played to stereotypes, provided shallow comic relief or merely died first to show that others were in danger  ?   the obnoxious gay best friend, the asexual Asian bookworm, the West Indian nanny. This type of character became such an established trope that the adult cartoon ?South Park? featured an   child actually named Token. At tokenism?s cheapest and laziest, a mascot isn?t even necessary. People counter accusations of racism by pointing to their close but unidentified black friends. One October Trump rally featured a prominent ?Blacks for Trump? sign that was held up by an elderly white woman. In politics, complaints about tokenism come from both sides. Those on the left accuse the right of using   tokens to create the false impression of a diverse, dynamic movement that both values and is supported by women and people of color. Those on the right accuse the left of valuing diversity over quality, ticking off racial boxes instead of insisting on merit. The defining difference between these analyses is obvious. In one, the suggestion is that people other than white men are qualified to do important jobs and too seldom get the chance in the other, the suggestion is that they often lack merit but are rewarded anyway. Last month on the Fox News program ?Hannity,? the Trump adviser Newt Gingrich hailed what he saw as Trump?s dedication to the quality of cabinet appointments over arbitrary diversity. ?This is what leads him to Jim Mattis,? Gingrich said. ?This is what leads him to Rick Perry. I mean, he?s going to look for the best to come in. It?s a piece of what Trumpism is, as opposed to liberalism, which would look for the right token, surrogate, even if they were incompetent. ? But just one week later, Gingrich changed his tune. ?There has to be more Hispanics in the administration,? he told Politico, which later reported that Trump?s search to fill that Department of Agriculture slot was extending even to people who were ?  and have no experience in agriculture. ? Many white kids grow up learning that they can be anything: an astronaut, an inventor, the president. Many minorities of a certain age and place, kids who grew up before the possibility of a black president, were bused up Route 295 to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore on   field trips, treated to speeches by a renowned neurosurgeon and taught that if they went to class, kept their heads in books and got good grades, they, too, could one day be like Ben Carson. I was one of those kids. This winter, while home for the holidays, I searched for his autobiography ?Gifted Hands,? and found it resting on a shelf in my childhood bedroom ?The Big Picture,? another of his books, was propped next to it, with my little brother?s name scrawled inside. A unique sort of sadness stirs within me when I watch Carson now. He is, in many ways, the best of us. Yet in the end, he?s just a tool for someone else. I recognize myself in him. My scholastic, athletic and professional careers have always taken me through   spaces in which I?m often alone and often the first. I?ve been called a token more times than I can count I?ve been one more times than I cared to. A token is always chosen, and there is a steady, throbbing angst that comes with being chosen over and over again, always knowing that, on some level, my abilities may be ancillary to my appearance. How do you know when you?re being used as an excuse? How can you tell the difference between a new employer who is making earnest steps toward diversity and one who is just trying to cover himself? What about the times when you know it?s the latter but want the spot, or need it, or tell yourself that being successful in it will crack the door wider for the next person? How do you prove that you belong? Can you?;;;;
17645;Michael Paulson;15/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;Jennifer Holliday, the   winning singer who on Friday said she planned to sing at an   welcome concert next week, on Saturday changed her mind, citing opposition to her appearance from the gay and lesbian community. Ms. Holliday, in a letter she provided to The Wrap, an entertainment news website, said she would no longer take part in any events affiliated with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president. Her decision to withdraw, she said, was influenced by an article in The Daily Beast about how her planned appearance was heartbreaking to her gay fans. She also retweeted an   piece in the Boston Globe describing Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees as ?a who?s who of homophobia. ? ?I sincerely apologize for my lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history and for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans,? she wrote. ?Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain,? she added. ?The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you.   ?     You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded. ? Her spokesman, William Carpenter, confirmed the withdrawal. ?After she saw how hurt so many people were at the idea of her performing, she decided to pull out and not cause any extra anger or hurt,? he said in an email. Ms. Holliday won a Tony Award in 1982 for her performance as Effie White in the original production of ?Dreamgirls,? and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in a revival of ?The Color Purple. ? In an interview on Friday, she said that although she had voted for Hillary Clinton for president, she agreed to sing at a welcome concert on the National Mall the day before Mr. Trump?s inauguration because she viewed it as a performance for the people, not the politician. She noted that she had performed at the invitation of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and viewed this invitation in that context. Nevertheless, her decision was greeted with a firestorm of opposition on social media from fans who argued that Mr. Trump is different from his Republican predecessors and that because of the nature of his rhetoric and his positions, she should not perform. On Saturday, she said she had found those arguments persuasive. ?I was honestly just thinking that I wanted my voice to be a healing and unifying force for hope through music to help our deeply polarized country,? she wrote. ?Regretfully, I did not take into consideration that my performing for the concert would actually instead be taken as a political act against my own personal beliefs and be mistaken for support of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. ? Ms. Holliday elaborated on her decision in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, expressing concern about remarks Mr. Trump made on Saturday on Twitter. He referred to Representative John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, as ?all talk, talk, talk  ?   no action or results. ?

17657;Diane Cardwell and Clifford Krauss;22/01/2017;2017;1;crime;ESCONDIDO, Calif.  ?   In Southern California in the fall of 2015, a giant natural gas leak not only caused one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation?s history, it also knocked out a critical fuel source for regional power plants. Energy regulators needed a quick fix. But rather than sticking with gas, they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights: batteries. They freed up the utilities to start installing batteries  ?   and lots of them. It is a solution that?s audacious and risky. The idea is that the batteries can store electricity during daylight hours (when the state?s many solar panels are flooding the grid with power) then release it as demand peaks (early evening, when people get home). In effect, the rechargeable batteries are like an   power plant, and, in theory, able to replace an actual plant. Utilities have been studying batteries nationwide. But none have moved ahead with the gusto of those in Southern California. This idea has   potential. But the challenge of storing electricity has vexed engineers, researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for centuries. Even as countless technologies have raced ahead, batteries haven?t yet fulfilled their promise. And the most powerful new designs come with their own risks, such as fire or explosion if poorly made or maintained. It?s the same problem that forced Samsung to recall 2. 5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in September because of fire risk. After racing for months, engineers here in California have brought three   sites close to completion to begin serving the Southern California electric grid within the next month. They are made up of thousands of oversize versions of the   batteries now widely used in smartphones, laptop computers and other digital devices. One of the installations, at a San Diego Gas  Electric operations center surrounded by industrial parks in Escondido, Calif. 30 miles north of San Diego, will be the largest of its kind in the world, developers say. It represents the most crucial test yet of an   technology that many experts see as fundamental to a   future. Here, about 130 miles southeast of Aliso Canyon, the site of the immense gas leak in 2015  ?   the   equivalent of operating about 1. 7 million cars over the course of a year  ?   19, 000 battery modules the size of a kitchen drawer are being wired together in racks. They will operate out of two dozen beige,    trailers. Made by Samsung, the batteries are meant to store enough energy to serve as a backup in cases of fuel shortages. They are also designed to absorb   energy, particularly solar power, during the day and feed it back to the grid after dusk. They in effect can fill in for the     plants that might lack the fuel to fully operate because of the disastrous leak. ?California is giving batteries the opportunity to show what they can do,? said Andr?s Gluski, chief executive of AES, which is installing the storage systems. AES is installing a smaller array for the electric utility in El Cajon, a suburb east of San Diego. And separately Tesla, the company perhaps better known for its electric cars, has built an array for a different utility on the grid, Southern California Edison, near Chino, Calif. The stakes are high for both energy storage companies. If their projects struggle or fail, it could jeopardize not only the stability of Southern California?s grid but also interest in the technology over all. After a smaller, but pioneering battery project at a wind farm on Oahu in Hawaii went up in flames in 2012, investment in battery storage all but dried up for a few years. That installation, which used 12, 000   batteries to help even out fluctuations in the power flow, caught fire three times in its first 18 months of operation. The storage developer, Xtreme, eventually went bankrupt. The wind farm turned to a different technology to smooth its output. Keeping a close eye on the Southern California battery efforts is Susan Kennedy, who helped shepherd California?s energy policy for more than a decade as a state utility regulator and   operative for two governors  ?   Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. She now runs an energy storage   one not involved in the   response to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. ?The moment one fails,? Ms. Kennedy said of the big bet on batteries, ?they won?t build any more. ? As soon as AES?s chief executive, Mr. Gluski, learned last June that San Diego Gas  Electric had awarded AES the big battery contract, he leapt out of his chair and interrupted a meeting in his board room at the company?s headquarters in Arlington, Va. As employees watched in astonishment, he barreled down two flights of stairs, grabbed a mallet and, with a ceremonial flourish, banged a gong that one of his executives kept on hand for big news. Mr. Gluski had not had much occasion to celebrate since he had taken the AES reins five years earlier. The company was struggling with debt and trying to coax profits from     projects around the developing world that are buffeted by instability in politics, currency and commodity prices. His first steps included an austerity program in which he gave up many of his own executive perks: No more   membership. No more corporate Audi A8, with driver. But the more   part of his plan would be AES?s battery division, which was then fledgling. The unit had roots in two midlevel executives who had been speculating about a   future over beers. Those two men, John Zahurancik, a science fiction fan, and Chris Shelton, a former physics teacher, had started talking about batteries a decade ago, before electric cars became fashionable or even feasible. In 2006, Mr. Shelton had come across a professor?s paper that predicted a future dominated by electric cars that, when parked, could be connected to the power grid so their batteries could act as storage devices to help balance electricity demand. He and Mr. Zahurancik bounced the idea off some AES colleagues, who said it was at least theoretically feasible. So the two continued their bull sessions but decided that stationary battery arrays may make more sense than relying on electric cars. At the time,   batteries, the standard in consumer products, were widely in use in the transportation and power tool industries, but no one had paired them with the technology necessary to serve the power grid. Earlier   experiments with   and other types of batteries worked only for a year or two before conking out. A different technology, ?flow batteries,? which use chemicals dissolved in liquids in tanks, were considered even more experimental. But lithium packs more energy per weight than other metals, offering the promise of greater energy density and longevity. The trick would be to figure out how to harness all that power, which creates heat, while avoiding the fires such batteries have caused in any number of vehicles and gadgets, including Teslas, HP computers, hoverboards and, most recently, Samsung Galaxy Note 7s. The two hit upon a design and persuaded executives to begin a pilot project in 2008. That eventually led to the first commercial   battery on a grid. Mr. Zahurancik, who owns the gong, is now president of AES Energy Storage. Mr. Shelton is now the company?s vice president and chief technology officer. AES does not actually make its batteries but buys them, along with other equipment, from manufacturers like Samsung, LG Chem and Panasonic. It designs and assembles the arrays, stacking the boxy batteries into racks inside   containers. In Escondido, where local radio stations still carry public service announcements about the   shortage, the AES battery packs are being installed at a critical spot on the regional electrical grid: the place where the giant wires from power plants and wind and solar arrays connect to the network of local wires. The batteries are intended to relieve the pressure on the system. Mainly, they will serve as a kind of sponge, soaking up excess or   solar energy during the day and then squeezing it back into the grid in the evening, when demand surges as the sun sets. There is enough capacity in the containers full of batteries to power about 20, 000 homes for four hours. The idea is that they help the utility lessen its dependence on the type of natural gas plants known as ?peakers,? which can turn on and off quickly to meet sudden peaks of demand but are generally used only for short periods and at great expense. And peakers, by burning fossil fuel, are also at odds with California?s   goals. The project is also being watched closely by advocates for renewable energy. The reason: If   battery installations work as designed, they would help wind or solar generators to act more like conventional power plants by working steadily even when the sun isn?t shining or the wind isn?t blowing. ?Energy storage is really the tool to do renewables integration for a utility infrastructure company like us,? said Josh Gerber, advanced technology integration manager of SDGE, as workers smoothed the   concrete pads that support the containers at the Escondido site. ?Without it, you have more risk that the variability of renewables is going to cause reliability problems. ? Under the contract, AES is responsible for making sure the batteries perform for 10 years, after which SDGE will take over. One potential downside is that if the batteries are fully charged and discharged each day, they could degrade more quickly. The executives involved expressed confidence in the design and reliability, despite Samsung?s recent smartphone problems. Not only are these batteries a different configuration than the smartphone units, executives said, but the larger footprint allows for the inclusion of sophisticated monitoring as well as industrial safety and cooling and ventilation equipment. The project, along with the smaller array AES has installed in El Cajon, could provide the    leap Mr. Gluski has been striving for. AES has a deal for an even bigger installation in a $1 billion project in Long Beach with Southern California Edison that is not part of the Aliso Canyon remediation effort it is projected to go online by the end of 2020. The electric company plans to use batteries as part of a plan to replace an aging gas plant along the San Gabriel River. Long term, Mr. Gluski plans to shift the company?s   portfolio  ?   still heavily based on coal and natural gas  ?   toward more renewable energy. He sees the storage systems as vital components in turning solar and wind energy into a dominant power source in the parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa where AES is active. Whatever progress it has made, AES still has its share of problems, with $20 billion in debt and a stock price less than   the value that it had at the start of the century. It faces wary, if not outright skeptical, treatment by Wall Street utility analysts and energy experts, who say the technology AES is peddling on such a large scale in California remains untested and financially risky. ?The problem comes if there is a hiccup with the battery storage business in California,? said Charles Fishman, a utilities analyst at Morningstar. ?You don?t have the   parent that can push money to it and keep it out of trouble. ? Despite all the battery activity in California, executives around the utility industry remain cautious. ?The reason we don?t have widespread batteries on our system is because it is not   for us,? said Alice Jackson, vice president for strategic revenue initiatives at Xcel, a giant electricity and gas utility serving eight Western and Midwestern states. Xcel has been testing batteries about as long as AES, but almost exclusively in small pilots. ?It?s fair to say we don?t have   experience with this technology to say that it is perfect, or a nirvana,? Ms. Jackson said. ?It?s something we?ll observe as California goes through its experience. ? California?s latest experiment with batteries is but the latest bout in the state?s long struggle to match its energy needs with its environmental sensibilities. In the early 2000s, after market deregulation and Enron?s notorious manipulation of gas supplies led to blackouts and financial instability among the power companies, state officials decided to lessen reliance on natural gas by encouraging the development of wind and solar. Under Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was governor until 2011, officials pushed through a raft of overlapping regulations that created a boom in renewables, especially solar. But that upended the traditional patterns of supply and demand, making the overall energy system technically and economically difficult to manage. Batteries were the logical solution. But the technology wasn?t fully developed and was still too expensive. In order for companies to make the necessary investments, they needed a signal that there would be a big enough market for their products. So in 2010, the state approved one of the first   mandates, ultimately requiring utilities to install some form of storage equipment in their territories. That set off a flurry of new investment and innovation and, after the sudden closure of the San Onofre nuclear plant on the coast in northwest San Diego County in 2012 when a steam generator tube sprung a leak, new contracts for battery installations. But the Aliso Canyon accident, which began on Oct. 23, 2015, when the Southern California Gas Company first detected the leak, put that process on  . The   gas and intermittent oily mist that spewed forth over almost four months traveled into the surrounding neighborhoods on the strong winds that sweep down from the Santa Susana Mountains. At the same time, it forced the battery strategy into its most   test yet. Now it?s showtime, and the pressure to succeed is high all around. For AES, it could signify an important step for a     relic that is seeking to revitalize itself as a powerhouse in battery storage and other advanced technologies. For   advocates  ?   including residents of the Porter Ranch section of Los Angeles, so   that Steven Spielberg chose it as the setting for the 1982 movie ?E. T.,? but where many still complain of the rashes, headaches and other debilitating symptoms that drove thousands from their homes during the leak  ?   it could be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep the gas depot closed. But the pressure may be highest for the Southern California utilities, their reputations still blackened by waves of forced electricity cuts that followed the Enron debacle. No one wants to contemplate a repeat of that chapter, when blackouts affected factories and even some hospitals. ?When the power goes out, people die,? said Ms. Kennedy, the former state official. ?Failure is not an option here on any level. ?;;;;
17671;Amanda Hess;16/01/2017;2017;1;law;A few weeks after the election of Donald J. Trump, pundits with their eyes glued to Twitter believed they?d finally deciphered the master plan behind the  ?s tweeting. Every time he detonated a   bomb on Twitter, they suspected, it was a sly bid to divert the public eye from more serious news about his impending administration. So when Mr. Trump reignited the dormant debate over flag burning one morning  ?   tweeting that those who set fire to the flag should suffer ?loss of citizenship or year in jail!?  ?   New York magazine?s Jonathan Chait quickly produced a column decoding the message. He called it a ?strange fight? and a ?classic   nationalist distraction? that proves Mr. Trump?s ?dangerous and authoritarian politics is calculated, and not merely crazy. ? But soon a competing theory emerged: Minutes before Mr. Trump?s tweet, ?Fox  Friends,? one of the  ?s favorite shows, ran a segment referencing an American flag burned on a college campus to protest his victory. He wasn?t carrying out some strategy. He was   his TV. Twitter is an impulsive medium. Log in and you?re greeted immediately with a text box asking ?What?s happening??  ?   as in, right this second. Mr. Trump, who is set to become the nation?s 45th president on Friday, is a master of Twitter, but also in its thrall. Theories of some grand Trump Twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of Mr. Trump?s for years. He famously avoids alcohol Twitter is his vice. And after eight years of     posts from @BarackObama, equally   journalists are transfixed by Mr. Trump?s timeline, too. Mr. Trump has always been hooked on recognition. He is obsessed with his television ratings. His office is festooned with   magazine covers featuring himself. Even negative attention can be a win he?s thrilled to be named Time?s ?Person of the Year? even if the cover might evoke images of both Hitler and Satan. But today magazine covers and TV hits lack the cultural dominance they once held. (As Mr. Trump tweeted in 2013, Time ?looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot! ?) Now he?s found a medium where recognition arrives every fraction of a second, and his reach is quantified in real time  ?   ratings, but for every sentence you ever write. Scroll through the list of accounts Mr. Trump follows and you?ll find a tightly curated crew of Trump relatives (like Ivanka)   properties (Trump Waikiki)   celebrities (Roma Downey, wife to ?The Apprentice? producer Mark Burnett) and reliably   outlets (?Fox  Friends,? naturally). It?s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for Twitter?s most uninhibited star, and it gives a glimpse at the image Mr. Trump intends to project: devoted family man, tremendous business magnate, friend to Gary Player. But Mr. Trump?s dominant posture is reactive, and his real focus is on who follows him. He almost exclusively retweets praise from fans. He tweets about all the credit he deserves (?Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night?) then waits for more virtual credit to roll in. He brags to journalists about the rate at which likes and retweets hit. He gets high on his own supply. Part of the peculiarity of Mr. Trump?s tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity, not a politician or a businessman. Even his handle, @realdonaldtrump, suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture. Though he?s preparing to assume the presidency, he tweets like a Hollywood social climber  ?   he fans celebrity feuds with Graydon Carter (?no talent?) and Meryl Streep (? ?) and posts product endorsements (?Buy L. L. Bean. ?). The highest office in the land has afforded Mr. Trump his most prominent celebrity perch. His account has risen from a few million followers to nearly 20 million in the past year. There was a time when some assumed that Mr. Trump?s public persona would evolve as he rose in the political ranks. But there?s just one Trump, and that?s been key to his success. As Kim Kardashian once said, the secret to social media dominance is authenticity and consistency. Mr. Trump?s projection of realness relies on him being reliably   and wildly inappropriate. That may seem like a liability for the leader of the free world, but it?s an asset in the   celebrity roles that have led him to this moment: reality TV boss, Howard Stern guest,   heel. Eight years ago, Barack Obama was the social media wonder headed to the White House, and his tech savvy was heralded as a bright light for democracy. The tweets he posts to @POTUS never seem impulsive they seem made for posterity. Even his jokes are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational. When the NASA rover Curiosity carried Mr. Obama?s signature to the surface of Mars, Mr. Obama responded in the form of a dad joke: ?That is out of this world. ? If Mr. Obama came to power in a time of great optimism for Twitter, Mr. Trump lords over a waning platform. What was once a hopeful place for global connection and resistance has become a site for coordinating harassment campaigns, connecting with white supremacists and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumors. Its growth has slumped and its stock price has stagnated. But the place suits Mr. Trump?s purposes fine. For the guy who?s all about appearances, Twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump?s incoming press secretary, has suggested that Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions, where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press. The social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms. All of this works because one group is as intoxicated by Twitter as Mr. Trump is: journalists. It?s hard to explain to a normal person  ?   one of the 79 percent of American adults who don?t use Twitter  ?   why the platform mesmerizes the news media. Its   search function means you can conjure material on any kind of news topic  ?   or just spend your time searching for your own name. Reporters still crave the ego rush of a published byline, but that pales in comparison to the animated feedback loop that Twitter offers. The more time you spend, and the more tweets you send, the bigger your following becomes. But Twitter provides little actual reach  ?   compared with Facebook or Google, it hardly drives any traffic to articles. It?s like a video game for professional validation. Mr. Trump expertly exploits journalists? unwavering attention to their Twitter feeds, their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic conventions  ?   chiefly, that what the president says is inherently newsworthy. As a developer and reality show star, he lobbied the news media for coverage. Now journalists feel obligated to pay attention to him. Mr. Trump overwhelms the media with boatloads of what was once a rare commodity: access. He creates impressions faster than journalists can check them. By the time they turn up the facts, the news cycle has moved on to his next missive, leaving less time (and reader attention) for the stories Mr. Trump does not highlight on his feed. Mr. Trump may not follow a deliberate distraction strategy, but he doesn?t need one. He distracts instinctively. All he needs is a phone, the press and whatever thought just entered his mind.;;;;
17685;Daniel E. Slotnik;16/01/2017;2017;1;entertainment;Tony Rosato, who was a cast member of the sketch shows ?Saturday Night Live? and ?SCTV? in the 1980s, but whose career ground to a halt when mental illness led to his incarceration in the 2000s, died on Tuesday at his home in Toronto. He was 62. His death was confirmed by his agent Ryan Goldhar, who said the cause had not been confirmed but appeared to be a heart attack. Mr. Rosato, an energetic actor and madcap impressionist, got his start with the Toronto company of the Second City improvisational troupe. In 1977 he became a performer and writer for ?SCTV? (originally titled ?Second City Television?) whose cast over the years would also feature Martin Short, John Candy, Catherine O?Hara and Rick Moranis. Mr. Rosato?s signature ?SCTV? character was Marcello, a clumsy and frequently soused   host. In 1981, Mr. Rosato and his ?SCTV? colleague Robin Duke moved to ?Saturday Night Live,? joining a cast headed by Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. He did not make much of an impression and left ?S. N. L. ? after only one season. He later played recurring roles on the Canadian police drama ?Night Heat? and did   work on cartoon shows. He worked steadily until the  . But then he began to unravel. In 2005 Mr. Rosato?s wife, Leah, left him and took their young daughter, citing his increasingly erratic behavior. He contacted the police that spring, claiming that his daughter had been abused and, later, that his family had been replaced by  . On May 5 he went to a police station to file a missing persons report about his family and was arrested and charged with criminal harassment. Mr. Rosato, who refused to acknowledge his mental illness, did not plead guilty and spent the next two years in a   facility awaiting trial. News media reports attributed the gap between Mr. Rosato?s arrest and trial to a combination of his intractability and the punitive approach of the Canadian authorities. ?Tony Rosato will have spent more time in custody on a harassment charge than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges,? his lawyer, Daniel Brodsky, told The Toronto Star before his trial finally began in 2007. A judge found Mr. Rosato guilty of criminal harassment that September. He was remanded to a psychiatric hospital, where he was found to have Capgras syndrome, a rare mental illness characterized by the delusion that loved ones have been replaced by impostors. At the hospital, he was required for the first time to take antipsychotic medication, and his delusions eventually abated. Mr. Rosato was released in 2009 and soon returned to work. He told The Toronto Star that he was thrilled to be free but that recovering from his ordeal would take time. ?Four years being inside is very hard on the spirit,? he said. Antonio Rosato was born on Dec. 26, 1954, in Naples, Italy. He moved to Canada with his family when he was a boy and became a naturalized citizen in 1966. After graduating from Oakwood Collegiate Institute in Toronto, he began studying chiropractic medicine at the University of Toronto but dropped out to become a performer. Mr. Rosato?s marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter, Giulietta Rosato.;;;;
17691;Amanda Taub;17/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   Since the emergence of an unverified dossier with salacious claims about   Donald J. Trump, Americans have debated the ramifications of the arrival of ?kompromat? as a feature of American politics. But those debates  ?   for example, over the ethics of publishing the dossier  ?   have often framed this practice as little more than a political form of blackmail, and one particular to Russia. In fact, kompromat is more than an individual piece of damaging information: It is a broader attempt to manufacture public cynicism and confusion in ways that target not just one individual but an entire society. And although this practice tends to be associated with Russia  ?   the word kompromat is a portmanteau of the Russian words for ?compromising? and ?information?  ?   it is a common feature of authoritarian and semiauthoritarian nations around the world. Specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals, but in the longer term, kompromat serves the interests of the powerful, which is why it is often a tool of autocrats. By eroding the very idea of a shared reality, and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike, kompromat undermines a society?s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government. When Katy E. Pearce, a professor of communications at the University of Washington in Seattle, began studying access to technology in Azerbaijan, she expected to focus her research on how it could be a positive tool for promoting political freedom. But she changed her tack after encountering widespread fear of the ways that the government could use technology as a tool of repression. ?When I was interviewing people, it kept on coming up and coming up,? she said. Kompromat is ?a very cheap and easy way for the regime to demonstrate its power, and to harass people in a very visible way,? she added. That was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to. But individual targets of kompromat are not its only victims, Professor Pearce said. It also harms society by diminishing public trust. Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King?s College London, wrote on Twitter that disinformation campaigns have ?often deliberately blended accurate and forged details? to sow distrust and confusion. If the news media and public figures publicize lies, they lose their credibility as trustworthy sources of information. ?There?s no reliable truth to rest upon,? Professor Pearce said. ?Every piece of information you get is ?possibly true, possibly false. ?? Degrading that trust can be deeply damaging. While in Russia in 2015, I was struck by how many of the people I met saw the world through a lens that I began to call the ?prudent hypothetical. ? They reacted to all information, whether from official sources or thirdhand rumors, as if it might be true. I came to realize that it was a   impulse, a way to prepare for any potential outcome in an unpredictable, unreliable world. But they were also careful not to rely on that information, lest it turn out to be a fabrication. They trusted only the facts they had verified themselves, and only the people to whom they had close personal ties. I had seen the same thing in Guatemala several years earlier. There, spreading lies and salacious gossip to discredit one?s enemies is referred to as a ?campa?a negra,? or a black campaign, rather than kompromat. But the result was the same: Public trust had been so eroded that lies were equally capable of destroying the honest and rehabilitating the criminal. When it appeared that Yasmn Barrios, the judge presiding over the trial of Gen. Efran Ros Montt, Guatemala?s former dictator, might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013, a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments, willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain. Leaks and rumors attacked Judge Barrios personally, but by extension, they also undermined the credibility of the justice system in which she worked. For example, the news media reported that the judge had been seen dining with ?foreign women? at a restaurant in Guatemala City, and suggested that this was evidence of foreign influence on her rulings. In fact, the ?foreigners? were Judge Barrios?s Guatemalan mother, her neighbor, and a nun who was a friend of the family. But the rumors had their desired effect: They discredited not only Judge Barrios but also the genocide trial. The Guatemalans I met knew that the stories they heard through the news media might be part of disinformation campaigns. But lacking better options, many still saw the world through the lens of the prudent hypothetical, viewing everything as possible and nothing as certain. When General Ros Montt was eventually convicted, many saw him as a victim of foreign machinations rather than a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity. (His conviction was later vacated on procedural grounds.) Professor Pearce said she saw parallels between the use of kompromat overseas and recent news in the United States. Although the Trump dossier purported to be a warning about kompromat elsewhere, she said, it could also be seen as a form of kompromat itself. She listed the parallels to what she had seen in her research: Its content is damaging but unverified. Its distribution was multilayered, with a website  ?   in this case, BuzzFeed  ?   publishing the unverified material and other outlets amplifying its impact by reporting on the ensuing controversy. The document also fostered uncertainty and division. Masha Gessen, a Russian journalist, wrote in a recent opinion column in The New York Times that the release of the dossier had allowed Mr. Trump to say that ?there was no such thing as truth, only a battle of opinions proffered by different actors, each of whom strives to be loudest. ? For some Americans, the dossier sowed concern about Mr. Trump?s vulnerability to Russian influence. Others saw its publication as evidence that Mr. Trump was the victim of a disinformation campaign. That may ultimately be to Mr. Trump?s benefit if   allegations against him arise in the future. Americans were similarly divided in their views on the hacking of the Democratic National Committee?s computer system. When Russian hackers leaked emails stolen from the committee, some saw it as evidence that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a victim of foreign machinations, while others viewed the documents? content as confirmation that Mrs. Clinton was unreliable and dishonest. The leaks distracted from more substantive campaign issues and fueled public distrust and rancor. Many people in the United States traditionally see the leak of confidential documents by   like Daniel Ellsberg?s release of the Pentagon Papers, as a way to hold the powerful to account. We tend to believe that transparency serves the public good, and secrecy the interests of the powerful. Such a belief presumes that there is a fixed quantity of hidden information out there that the news media is or is not revealing. But in a kompromat society, incriminating material, real and fake, will be manufactured as needed to serve a political purpose. To smear a president, undermine a judge or sow distrust in an institution or process, all someone needs to do is create a set of documents salacious enough to attract discussion, persuade some corner of the web to publish them and then wait for the resulting controversy to be reported as news. That does not hold the powerful to account. And worse, it undermines the institutions that are supposed to do so. In the United States, Professor Pearce said, ?grabbing on and holding to the truth is becoming more challenging. ? If kompromat becomes a more widespread tactic, public trust will erode even further. ?A lot of the things that are good about the U. S. are because we have this kind of   scaffolding,? she said. ?I don?t want to live in an environment where I?m having to really be skeptical of everything, like people in authoritarian regimes have to be. ? ?Living like that is horrible,? she said. ?It is exhausting. ?;;;;
17695;Abby Goodnough;17/01/2017;2017;1;science;ROSWELL, Ga.  ?   It was 1 in the morning, and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck, after hours of tending to other patients. The woman?s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, ?Are you too tired to do this?? ?He looked me straight in the eye  ?   very quiet guy  ?   and said, ?I was born to do this,?? Mr. Anderson recalled. The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia,   Donald J. Trump?s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration?s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as   government intrusion. Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta?s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies  ?   seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career. Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price?s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone. If confirmed, Mr. Price, 62, will soon have far more power to influence the nation?s vast health care system than he ever did as a lawmaker. One of his first tasks would be to help Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress determine how to eviscerate and replace the health law, a goal he has held since the law?s passage in 2010. But as leader of the agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. Price would also hold considerable regulatory power, with the ability to influence everything from how applications to market new drugs are reviewed to how doctors are compensated for treating elderly and poor patients. As Mr. Price prepares for two confirmation hearings  ?   the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday  ?   his past efforts on behalf of   companies, which have donated generously to his campaigns, are under scrutiny. So, too, is Mr. Price?s history of trading in biomedical, pharmaceutical and health insurance stocks while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. Democrats have called for investigations into whether he traded stock based on information he gleaned as a congressman. Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients Mr. Price?s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer?s political action committee contributed to his   campaign the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price ?had no knowledge or input into the purchase? of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying   stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, ?We know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on   legislation. ? In a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43   and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an ?exhaustive review? of Mr. Price?s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price ?takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously. ? Although not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health   companies including Aetna,   Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13. 6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective  : Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173, 000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him ?Dr. Dollar. ? A brisk,   workaholic who relishes the granular details of legislative proposals and process, Mr. Price expressed concern last year about Mr. Trump?s grasp of the issues. Taking questions from a student group at Emory University, he said he had voted for Marco Rubio in the Republican primary and called Mr. Trump an ?empty policy vessel? who was ?dangerous for politics and the economy,? according to the student newspaper. Mr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning   marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor. He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law?s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits. Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich. the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta. In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1, 000 employees spread over 21 locations. Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M. R. I. s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations   rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates. ?His overall gist was, ?Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we?d be broke by tomorrow,?? Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. ?He understood the need to run a business. ? As a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies? approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy  ?   a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records. ?Those are the things that drove him crazy,? Dr. Wertheim said. His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol. For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady?s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the   privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady?s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload. ?He called me and asked if there was a position,? said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. ?He needed some flexibility  ?   that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career. ? Dr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a ?unique role? at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies  ?   long wait times, for example  ?   and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night  ?   an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said. In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip. His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands. As the majority leader, Mr. Price?s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party?s agenda. In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the   tactician to some of his   colleagues? more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept. ?He?s a machine,? said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price. During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price?s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed. ?He was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,? said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors? liability in malpractice cases. ?But he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible. ? Ultimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped    damages for malpractice victims at $250, 000. Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga. said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction. ?There was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,? Mr. Paul said, ?and that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior. ? In Congress, Mr. Price has made frequent speeches to health industry and physician groups, and has occasionally introduced legislation on their behalf. Last year, for example, he sponsored a bill fighting new lower Medicare payment rates for ?durable medical equipment? like wheelchairs and canes. A few months later, he spoke at a conference for companies that supply such equipment, which held a $     on his behalf that same day. Mr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare  ?   potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to ?touch? the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected. ?When I hear Trump saying things like, ?I?ll just do XYZ,? without seemingly any regard for the legislative branch,? Mr. Price told the group, ?it gives me some thought. ?;;;;
17699;;19/01/2017;2017;1;business;Michiko Kakutani, the chief book critic for The New York Times, interviewed President Obama about literature on Friday at the White House. Here are excerpts from the conversation, which have been edited and condensed.  These books that you gave to your daughter Malia on the Kindle, what were they? Some of your favorites? I think some of them were sort of the usual suspects, so ?The Naked and the Dead? or ?One Hundred Years of Solitude,? I think she hadn?t read yet. Then there were some books I think that are not on everybody?s reading list these days, but I remembered as being interesting, like ?The Golden Notebook? by Doris Lessing, for example. Or ?The Woman Warrior,? by Maxine [Hong Kingston]. Part of what was interesting was me pulling back books that I thought were really powerful, but that might not surface when she goes to college. Have you had a chance to discuss them with her? I?ve had the chance to discuss some. And she?s interested in being a filmmaker, so storytelling is of great interest to her. She had just read ?A Moveable Feast. ? I hadn?t included that, and she was just captivated by the idea that Hemingway described his goal of writing one true thing every day. What made you want to become a writer? I loved reading when I was a kid, partly because I was traveling so much, and there were times where I?d be displaced, I?d be the outsider. When I first moved to Indonesia, I?m this big,   kid that kind of stood out. And then when I moved back from Indonesia to Hawaii, I had the manners and habits probably of an Indonesian kid. And so the idea of having these worlds that were portable, that were yours, that you could enter into, was appealing to me. And then I became a teenager and wasn?t reading that much other than what was assigned in school, and playing basketball and chasing girls, and imbibing things that weren?t very healthy. I think all of us did. Yeah. And then I think rediscovered writing and reading and thinking in my first or second year of college and used that as a way to rebuild myself, a process I write about in ?Dreams From My Father. ? That  period in New York, where you were intensely reading. I was hermetic  ?   it really is true. I had one plate, one towel, and I?d buy clothes from thrift shops. And I was very intense, and sort of humorless. But it reintroduced me to the power of words as a way to figure out who you are and what you think, and what you believe, and what?s important, and to sort through and interpret this swirl of events that is happening around you every minute. And so even though by the time I graduated I knew I wanted to be involved in public policy, or I had these vague notions of organizing, the idea of continuing to write and tell stories as part of that was valuable to me. And so I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two. The great thing was that it was useful in my organizing work. Because when I got there, the guy who had hired me said that the thing that brings people together to have the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issue, it?s that they have shared stories. And he told me that if you learn how to listen to people?s stories and can find what?s sacred in other people?s stories, then you?ll be able to forge a relationship that lasts. But my interest in public service and politics then merged with the idea of storytelling. What were your short stories like? It?s interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people. I think part of the reason was because I was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me. We were going into churches, and probably the average age of these folks was 55, 60. A lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, but just barely. They were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay  ?   steel mills had closed, and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities. And so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment. And so a bunch of the short stories I wrote had to do with that sense, that atmosphere. One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and he?s got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple  ?   a white couple in L. A.  ?   and he?s like in advertising, wrote jingles. And he?s just retired and has gotten cranky. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over. So when I think back on what?s interesting to me, there is not a lot of Jack Kerouac,   young kid on the make discovering stuff. It?s more melancholy and reflective. Was writing partly a way to figure out your identity? Yes, I think so. For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life  ?   race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. People now remark on this notion of me being very cool, or composed. And what is true is that I generally have a pretty good sense of place and who I am, and what?s important to me. And I trace a lot of that back to that process of writing. Has that continued to be so in the presidency? Not as much as I would have liked. I just didn?t have time. But you keep some form of a journal? I?ve kept some, but not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for. The main writing that I?ve done during the presidency has been my speeches, the ones at least that were important to me. How has the speechwriting and  being at the center of history and dealing with crises affected you as a writer? I?m not sure yet. I?ll have to see when I start writing the next book. Some of the craft of writing a good speech is identical to any other good writing: Is that word necessary? Is it the right word? Is there a rhythm to it that feels good? How does it sound aloud? I actually think that one of the useful things about speechwriting is reminding yourself that the original words are spoken, and that there is a sound, a feel to words that, even if you?re reading silently, transmits itself. So in that sense, I think there will be some consistency. But this is part of why it was important to pick up the occasional novel during the presidency, because most of my reading every day was briefing books and memos and proposals. And so working that very analytical side of the brain all the time sometimes meant you lost track of not just the poetry of fiction, but also the depth of fiction. Fiction was useful as a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day and was a way of seeing and hearing the voices, the multitudes of this country. Are there examples of specific novels or writers? Well, the last novel I read was Colson Whitehead?s ?The Underground Railroad. ? And the reminder of the ways in which the pain of slavery transmits itself across generations, not just in overt ways, but how it changes minds and hearts. It?s what you said in your farewell address about Atticus Finch, where you said people are so isolated in their little bubbles. Fiction can leap  ?   It bridges them. I struck up a friendship with [the novelist] Marilynne Robinson, who has become a good friend. And we?ve become sort of pen pals. I started reading her in Iowa, where ?Gilead? and some of her best novels are set. And I loved her writing in part because I saw those people every day. And the interior life she was describing that connected them  ?   the people I was shaking hands with and making speeches to  ?   it connected them with my grandparents, who were from Kansas and ended up journeying all the way to Hawaii, but whose foundation had been set in a very similar setting. And so I think that I found myself better able to imagine what?s going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency because of not just a specific novel but the act of reading fiction. It exercises those muscles, and I think that has been helpful. And then there?s been the occasion where I just want to get out of my own head. [Laughter] Sometimes you read fiction just because you want to be someplace else. What are some of those books? It?s interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things  ?   some science fiction. For a while, there was a     novel, the ?  Problem? series  ?   Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.  ?   which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting. It wasn?t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping  ?   It?s really about the fate of the universe. Exactly. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my    problems with Congress seem fairly petty  ?   not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade. [Laughter] There were books that would blend, I think, really good writing with thriller genres. I mean, I thought ?Gone Girl? was a     book. I loved that structure. Yeah, and it was really well executed. And a similar structure, that I thought was a really powerful novel: ?Fates and Furies,? by Lauren Groff. I like those structures  where you actually see different points of view. Which I have to do for this job, too. [Laughter] Have there been certain books that have been touchstones for you in these eight years? I would say Shakespeare continues to be a touchstone. Like most teenagers in high school, when we were assigned, I don?t know, ?The Tempest? or something, I thought, ?My God, this is boring.? And I took this wonderful Shakespeare class in college where I just started to read the tragedies and dig into them. And that, I think, is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings. Is that sort of comforting? It gives me a sense of perspective. I think Toni Morrison?s writings  ?   particularly ?Song of Solomon? is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship. That it?s not just pain, but there?s joy and glory and mystery. I think that there are writers who I don?t necessarily agree with in terms of their politics, but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things  ?   V. S. Naipaul, for example. His ?A Bend in the River,? which starts with the line, ?The world is what it is men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it. ? And I always think about that line, and I think about his novels when I?m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true. So in that sense, I?m using writing like that as a foil or something to debate against. I?ve read that Lincoln  loved Shakespeare his whole life, but  when he was dealing with the Civil War,  reading the  history plays helped give him solace and perspective. Lincoln?s own writings do that. He is a very fine writer. I?d put the Second Inaugural up against any piece of American writing  ?   as good as anything. One of the great treats of being president is, in the Lincoln Bedroom, there?s a copy of the Gettysburg Address handwritten by him, one of five copies he did for charity. And there have been times in the evening when I?d just walk over, because it?s right next to my office, my home office, and I just read it. And perspective is exactly what is wanted. At a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted, the ability to slow down and get perspective, along with the ability to get in somebody else?s shoes  ?   those two things have been invaluable to me. Whether they?ve made me a better president, I can?t say. But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years, because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn?t let up. Is there some poem or any  writing or author that you would turn to, say,  after the mass killings in Newtown, Conn. or during the financial crisis? I think that during those periods, Lincoln?s writings, King?s writings, Gandhi?s writings, Mandela?s writings  ?   I found those particularly helpful, because what you wanted was a sense of solidarity. During very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating. So sometimes you have to hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated. Churchill?s a good writer. And I loved reading Teddy Roosevelt?s writing. He?s this big, outsize character. Have you read a lot of presidential biographies?  The biographies have been useful, because I do think that there?s a tendency, understandable, to think that whatever?s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult. And it just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate World War II or Lincoln trying to figure out whether he?s going to fire [George B.] McClellan when Rebel troops are 20, 30, 40 miles away. I watched some of the    documentary   ?Eyes on the Prize? after the election.  It was useful. You do see how far we?ve come, and in the space of my lifetime. And that?s why seeing my daughters now picking up books that I read 30 years ago or 40 years ago is gratifying, because I want them to have perspective  ?   not for purposes of complacency, but rather to give them confidence that people with a sense of determination and courage and pluck can reshape things. It?s empowering for them. What books would you recommend at this moment in time, that  captures this sense of turmoil? I should probably ask you or some people who have had time to catch up on reading. I?ll confess that since the election, I?ve been busier than I expected. So one of the things I?m really looking forward to is to dig into a whole bunch of literature. But one of the things I?m confident about is that, out of this moment, there are a whole bunch of writers, a lot of them young, who are probably writing the book I need to read. [Laughter] They?re ahead of me right now. And so in my   in addition to training the next generation of leaders to work on issues like climate change or gun violence or criminal justice reform, my hope is to link them up with their peers who see fiction or nonfiction as an important part of that process. When so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify  ?   as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize  ?   is more important than ever. There?s something particular about quieting yourself and having a sustained stretch of time that is different from music or television or even the greatest movies. And part of what we?re all having to deal with right now is just a lot of information overload and a lack of time to process things. So we make quick judgments and assign stereotypes to things, block certain things out, because our brain is just trying to get through the day. We?re bombarded with information. Technology is moving so rapidly. Look, I don?t worry about the survival of the novel. We?re a storytelling species. I think that what one of the jobs of political leaders going forward is, is to tell a better story about what binds us together as a people. And America is unique in having to stitch together all these disparate elements  ?   we?re not one race, we?re not one tribe, folks didn?t all arrive here at the same time. What holds us together is an idea, and it?s a story about who we are and what?s important to us. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I know you like Junot Daz?s and Jhumpa Lahiri?s books, and they speak to immigration or the American Dream. I think Lahiri?s books, I think Daz?s books, do speak to a very particular contemporary immigration experience. But also this combination of  ?   that I think is universal  ?   longing for this better place, but also feeling displaced and looking backwards at the same time. I think in that sense, their novels are directly connected to a lot of American literature. Some of the great books by Jewish authors like Philip Roth or Saul Bellow, they are steeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you?re giving up  ?   what you?re willing to give up and what you?re not willing to give up. So that particular aspect of American fiction I think is still of great relevance today.;;;;
17711;Charlie Savage;21/01/2017;2017;1;politics;WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama on Tuesday commuted all but four months of the remaining prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Army intelligence analyst convicted of a 2010 leak that revealed American military and diplomatic activities across the world, disrupted Mr. Obama?s administration and brought global prominence to WikiLeaks, the recipient of those disclosures. The decision by Mr. Obama rescued Ms. Manning, who twice tried to kill herself last year, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman incarcerated at the men?s military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. She has been jailed for nearly seven years, and her   sentence was by far the longest punishment ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction. At the same time that Mr. Obama commuted the sentence of Ms. Manning, a   enlisted soldier at the time of her leaks, he also pardoned James E. Cartwright, the retired Marine general and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with reporters to F. B. I. agents investigating a leak of classified information about cyberattacks on Iran?s nuclear program. The two acts of clemency were a remarkable final step for a president whose administration carried out an unprecedented criminal crackdown on leaks of government secrets. Depending on how they are counted, the Obama administration has prosecuted either nine or 10 such cases, more than were charged under all previous presidencies combined. In addition, Mr. Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was part of a Puerto Rican nationalist group that carried out a string of bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s the other members of that group had long since been freed. Mr. Obama also granted 63 other pardons and 207 other commutations, mostly for drug offenders. Under the terms of the commutation announced by the White House on Tuesday, Ms. Manning is set to be freed on May 17 of this year rather than in 2045. A senior administration official said the   delay was part of a standard transition period for commutations to time served, and was designed to allow for such steps as finding a place for Ms. Manning to live after her release. The commutation also relieved the Defense Department of the difficult responsibility of Ms. Manning?s incarceration as she pushes for treatment for her gender dysphoria, including sex reassignment surgery, that the military has no experience providing. But the move was sharply criticized by several prominent Republicans, including the chairmen of the House and Senate armed services committees, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who called her leaks ?espionage? and said they had put American troops and the country at risk. Speaker Paul D. Ryan called it ?outrageous. ? ?President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won?t be held accountable for their crimes,? he said in a statement. But in a joint statement, Nancy Hollander and Vince Ward  ?   two lawyers who have been representing Ms. Manning in appealing her conviction and sentence, and who filed the commutation application  ?   praised the decision. ?Ms. Manning is the     in the history of the United States,? they said. ?Her   sentence for disclosing information that served the public interest and never caused harm to the United States was always excessive, and we?re delighted that justice is being served in the form of this commutation. ? In recent days, the White House had signaled that Mr. Obama was seriously considering granting Ms. Manning?s commutation application, in contrast to a pardon application submitted on behalf of the other   leaker of the era, Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who disclosed archives of   surveillance files and is living as a fugitive in Russia. Asked about the two clemency applications on Friday, the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, discussed the ?pretty stark difference? between Ms. Manning?s case for mercy and Mr. Snowden?s. While their offenses were similar, he said, there were ?some important differences. ? ?Chelsea Manning is somebody who went through the military criminal justice process, was exposed to due process, was found guilty, was sentenced for her crimes, and she acknowledged wrongdoing,? he said. ?Mr. Snowden fled into the arms of an adversary and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy. ? Mr. Earnest also noted that while the documents Ms. Manning provided to WikiLeaks were ?damaging to national security,? the ones Mr. Snowden disclosed were ?far more serious and far more dangerous. ? (None of the documents Ms. Manning disclosed were classified above the merely ?secret? level.) Ms. Manning was still known as Bradley Manning when she deployed with her unit to Iraq in late 2009. There, she worked as a   intelligence analyst helping her unit assess insurgent activity in the area it was patrolling, a role that gave her access to a classified computer network. She copied hundreds of thousands of military incident logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which, among other things, exposed abuses of detainees by Iraqi military officers working with American forces and showed that civilian deaths in the Iraq war were probably much higher than official estimates. The files she copied also included about 250, 000 diplomatic cables from American embassies showing sensitive deals and conversations, dossiers detailing intelligence assessments of Guantnamo detainees held without trial, and a video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad in which two Reuters journalists were killed, among others. She decided to make all these files public, as she wrote at the time, in the hope that they would incite ?worldwide discussion, debates and reforms. ? WikiLeaks disclosed them  ?   working with traditional news organizations including The New York Times  ?   bringing notoriety to the group and its founder, Julian Assange. The disclosures set off a frantic scramble as Obama administration officials sought to minimize any potential harm, including getting to safety some foreigners in dangerous countries who were identified as having helped American troops or diplomats. Prosecutors, however, presented no evidence that anyone had been killed because of the leaks. At her   Ms. Manning confessed in detail to her actions and apologized, saying she had not intended to put anyone at risk and noting that she had been ?dealing with a lot of issues? at the time she made her decision. Testimony showed that she had been in a mental and emotional crisis as she came to grips, amid the stress of a war zone, with the fact that she was not merely gay but had gender dysphoria. She had been behaving erratically, including angry outbursts and lapsing into catatonia midsentence. At one point, she had emailed a photograph of herself in a woman?s wig to her supervisor. Prosecutors said that because the secret material was made available for publication on the internet, anyone, including Al Qaeda, could read it. And they accused Ms. Manning of treason, charging her with multiple counts under the Espionage Act, as well as with ?aiding the enemy,? a potential capital offense, although they said they would not seek her execution. Ms. Manning confessed and pleaded guilty to a lesser version of those charges without any deal to cap her sentence. But prosecutors pressed forward with a trial and won convictions on the more serious versions of those charges a military judge acquitted her of ?aiding the enemy. ? In her commutation application, Ms. Manning said she had not imagined that she would be sentenced to the ?extreme? term of 35 years, a term for which there was ?no historical precedent. ? (There have been only a handful of leak cases, and most sentence are one to three years.) After her sentencing, Ms. Manning announced that she was transgender and changed her name to Chelsea. The military, under pressure from a lawsuit filed on her behalf by Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, has permitted her to partly transition to life as a woman, including giving her   hormones and letting her wear women?s undergarments and light cosmetics. But it has not let her grow her hair longer than male military standards, citing security risks, and Ms. Manning said she had yet to be permitted to see a surgeon about the possibility of sex reassignment surgery. Until recently, the military discharged transgender soldiers. In June, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter changed that policy and said the military would instead provide treatment for them, eventually including such surgery if doctors said it was necessary.   Donald J. Trump mocked that change as excessively ?politically correct,? raising the possibility that he will rescind it. But even if he does, Ms. Manning will soon no longer be subject to the military?s control.;;;;
